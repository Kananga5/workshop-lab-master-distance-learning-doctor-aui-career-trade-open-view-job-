    LABS
    DL NGL-CLOUD
    Module for the study of cloud computingDL NGL
    The 'Cloud Computing' module contains devices and tools for analysing and experimenting at an educational
    level with this latest generation information technology that allows managing processing resources on
    remote devices, connected to the Internet, which allow for global use of the contents.
    The Cloud Computing paradigm is gaining more and more ground in corporate IT innovation, as it allows
    renting processing resources "on demand", without the need to manage the necessary machines (servers)
    on site, reducing maintenance costs (breakage of hardware components, addition of processing resources
    such as CPU, RAM or mass memory) and allowing a use of resources suited to the application they must
    support.
    Further advantages are the possibility of
    increasing resources the instant they are needed
    (e.g., due to a sudden increase in the workload
    generated by a traffic burst) and being able to
    reduce them the instant they are no longer
    needed, ensuring cost savings.
    This "abstraction" of cloud computing also
    makes it possible not to have to keep the physical
    machines directly on site, reducing the times in
    which the application is offline due to failures of
    the infrastructure or of the machines
    themselves.
    The Module allows configuring and using a private Cloud Computing system within the Laboratory.
    It consists of a Server equipped with all the necessary software components:
    • Preconfigured physical server
    • Physical hardware
    • Ubuntu Operating System
    • Apache CloudStack cloud computing platform and its software requirements
    • Open Office, MySQL Database
    The resources of this server can be accessed autonomously from the laboratory workstations, using a
    browser (e.g., Google Chrome) to connect to the Apache CloudStack web interface.
    There is also a command prompt with SSH connection capability: Putty for Windows environment.
    This solution of implementing a physical Server inside the Laboratory, instead of using Servers available
    online on the Internet with their Cloud Computing services, certainly has positive aspects both in terms of
    performance and, in the medium and long term, in terms of costs avoiding the burden of periodic payment
    for the service.DL NGL
    CloudStack allows configuring Virtual Machines, which reside on the Server, but which are used by Remote
    Users. For each machine you can set resources such as: number of cores, memory, disk space, etc.
    The activity of all Virtual Machines is controlled on the server, in real time, using the appropriate CloudStack
    tools.
    Once users of the system have connected to one of the Virtual Machines, they can work on them as if they
    were computers on their workstation. It works with the Ubuntu Operating System and with all its individual
    productivity tools: Editor, Spreadsheet, database, etc.

    DL NGL-CIMSIM
    Module for the study of a conveyor beltDL NGL
    The design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems is an essential technique in the
    field of electronic engineering and computer engineering.
    With this board system, students can study the properties of a conveyor belt used in industrial environments.
    Sensors and actuators are included for the development of a complete course on the main characteristics of
    conveying systems and their applications.
    The system is equipped with SCADA software for studying automation and industry 4.0 concepts and can be
    combined with the other simulators of the family to simulate a simplified industrial 4.0 factory.
    The system for studying a conveyor belt consists of two main elements:

    boards include all the components, sensors, and actuators needed to understand and manage the
    operation of a conveyor belt.
    • A real hardware simulator of a conveyor belt used in industrial environments. Through this simulator,
    the student will be able to learn how to operate and control a production line through the use of a PLC
    and an open-source microcontroller. Its structure allows the connection of the components included in
    the board kit, making them compatible with each other.
    The integration of the belt conveyor system in an industrial process is possible through a SCADA software,
    which allows a study on the concept of automation and Industry 4.0.
    With the card and the respective simulator, the DL NGL interacts through a gateway software allowing the
    passage of information between devices that use different communication protocols, guaranteeing the
    compatibility between them by their interoperability and by providing a common interface for their
    communication. The end user can monitor, interact, acquire, and analyse the data generated by interactions
    to manage and optimize the entire industrial process.DL NGL

    DL NGL-CYBER
    Module for the study of cybersecurityDL NGL
    The 'Cybersecurity' module has been developed for the study of the problems relating to the security of
    devices, networks and systems.
    It addresses the various issues starting from a complete analysis of the OSI model, providing the student with
    a holistic view of security which he can then apply to the various areas in which he will operate.
    In fact, the OSI model is an essential tool, not only for understanding how a network works, but also for
    understanding where cyber threats arise and what steps to take to eliminate them.
    Data within networks travel through various layers represented by the OSI Model and, at each layer, there
    are different types of vulnerabilities.
    To comprehensively address network vulnerability issues, action must be taken at every level.
    Security issues at various levels include:
    protection against unwanted physical access,
    ARP spoofing, unwanted data access, capture of
    personal information such as identifiers and
    passwords, worms and viruses.
    The security tools and solutions used include:
    physical access restriction, private Virtual LAN,
    Firewalls, information encryption, network user
    authentication, anti-virus tools.
    The Module consists of a series of software tools,
    which integrate with the DL WORKSPACE, which
    allow the study and experimentation at the
    different levels of the OSI model on security
    issues: Servers, Clients, Packet Analyzers,
    Network Analyzers, etc.
    Practical exercises are included, such as the one that simulates a 'man in the middle' type attack, where a
    hacker places himself between a Client and a Server and, capturing the communication packets that pass on
    the network, is able to steal sensitive information such as identifiers and passwords.
    The solution to this type of attack is to encrypt the data with a secret key before sending it over the network.DL NGL
    The DL WORKSPACE contains the encryption tools for
    performing these kinds of hands-on experiences.
    Other fundamental experiences for learning
    Cybersecurity issues are those relating to the Firewalls
    contained in the Routers of home computer networks,
    which protect home networks from unwanted access.
    Firewalls are hardware and software devices designed
    to protect our private networks from intrusion by
    strangers while connected to the Internet.
    It is, therefore, necessary to pay the utmost attention to
    the configuration of the Router: in the event that some
    'chink' is left open, a hacker could exploit it to access
    devices and personal data.
    The Module contains Routers to perform Firewall
    configuration exercises to optimize the security level of
    your home networks.

    DL NGL-DATA
    Module for the study of big dataDL NGL
    The 'Big Data' module deals with the study of the processing and analysis of large amounts of data in the
    context of Data Science.
    Big Data differs from traditional data collections in several characteristics: the amount of data, the fact that
    data is generally unstructured because it comes from different sources and forms and, in the case of real
    time streaming, the speed with which the data arrives.
    New technologies have been introduced in Data Science that deal with the management and analysis of large
    data, overcoming the limitations of traditional data management systems such as relational DBMS (Database
    Management System).
    The ‘Big Data’ module uses Apache Spark, an open-source framework that supports in-memory parallel
    computing to optimize the performance of applications that analyse Big Data.
    It is used by a great many organizations around the world, including IBM, NASA, Samsung and Yahoo!, and
    its use is constantly expanding.
    Within the Module, simple applications will be
    developed using the Python programming
    language.
    The 'Big Data' module addresses the main issues
    of big data processing with an informative
    approach and with practical exercises that make
    learning more effective.
    The data that is analysed can be of different types:
    structured, semi-structured or unstructured. The
    most common structures in Apache Spark are:
    DataFrame, dataset and RDD (Resilient
    Distributed Dataset).
    The analysis of Big Data often has the objective of
    making predictions or deriving any strategies for
    users based on the available data.
    For advanced analysis and Machine Learning-type processing, the Spark MLib library is used, which allows
    performing preliminary data analyses, implementing regression and classification models, making
    predictions, but also clustering.
    In fact, it provides various algorithms, such as those for linear regression, the K-means method, the random
    forests, etc.
    The Module will examine different processing techniques with different purposes, for example, Supervised
    Learning in which, starting from historical data, we will try to train a model to predict future data through an
    iterative optimization algorithm.DL NGL
    Or, the Unsupervised Learning, where you try to find
    patterns or discover the underlying structure in a set
    of data.
    This methodology is particularly indicated in the
    search for anomalies, but it is also very useful in
    marketing, to carry out segmentation and, therefore,
    identify groups that are as homogeneous internally
    and heterogeneous as possible.
    Finally, the processing of data represented by graphs,
    graph operators, graph algorithms, graph builders and
    other techniques are examined. A graph is a set of
    nodes (or vertices) connected to each other through
    arcs and can be used to represent, for example, the
    friendship network in a social network where the
    nodes are people while the arcs represent friendships.
    Spark's GraphX library provides algorithms for
    measuring the importance of a node, the presence of
    any hubs, calculating connected components,
    calculating triangles, etc.
    Most of the practical exercises will be carried out on
    real data taken from the site www.kaggle.com, which
    contains datasets accessible to all and of different
    formats.

    DL NGL-IOT
    Module for the study of the Internet of ThingsDL NGL
    The term "Internet of Things" identifies a system in which not only people are able to connect to a Global
    Network, but also the most common objects.
    These objects can be seen and controlled both by other
    objects and by network users.
    There is no limitation to the type of object that can be
    connected, thus providing the Internet of Things with
    an unlimited space of applications: industry, home
    automation, medicine, etc.
    The 'IoT' Module adds to the Basic Module the devices and tools for the study and learning of all topics related
    to the Internet of Things.
    With this module you can acquire skills on all issues related to the IoT world:
    • Characteristics and performance of the devices to be connected: sensors, actuators, etc.
    • Communication technologies: protocols, networks, etc.
    • Information technologies:server, database, client, etc.
    • Analysis of performance, safety, etc. of the system.
    The Module consists of devices and tools to set up a complete IoT system, where to carry out all the exercises
    and experiments:
    • DevIoT Unit, with sensors, actuators and connection interfaces to wired and wireless networks. It is
    supplied with Firmware for immediate use, but it is also programmable via the Arduino development
    platform to allow users to develop customized applications.
    • IoT Server and Client (with MQTT protocol).
    • Service toolsfor testing and functional analysis: protocol analysers, Wi-Fi analysers, network traffic meters,
    etc.
    The figure shows the laboratory network and how the devices of the IoT Module find their space within it to
    provide a complete system that represents a real IoT application.
    The IoT Module can be integrated with the miniSim series Simulators that allow studying different IoT
    applications:
    • Energy
    • Agriculture
    • Chemistry
    • Biomedical
    • Manufacturing
    • Automotive
    Through the tools made available, they reproduce complete IoT systems in a single workstation, in an 'open'
    form, where the student can therefore interact independently with the different parts of the system in
    learning operations, at any level.DL NGL
    Devices and tools are described below.

    MQTT (IoT) Broker and Client and Service Tools
    An IoT application is basically a 'distributed' application. where the various components of the system
    (sensors, servers, clients, actuators, etc.), located in different places, communicate with each other through
    the Internet. Reproposing distributed systems of this type at an educational level, where the student, in order
    to be able to learn, must see inside the system how information passes from one component to another, is
    impossible using directly Servers available online on the Internet with their hosting services. For this reason,
    the IoT Module is equipped with software to implement IoT Server (Broker) and Client, integrated in the DL
    WORKSPACE environment, and, therefore, usable on all workstations.
    All this allows each Student, with the resources of his own workstation, to set up a complete IoT System and
    to experiment on it at any level. He is, therefore, enabled to learn the various problems that underlie systems
    of this type, working autonomously on his own workstation and proceeding at his own learning speed.DL NGL
    MQTT Broker
    DL WORKSPACE provides an MQTT Broker for all
    exercises related to the IoT. This is the
    indispensable tool for connecting the various
    devices of the system to each other. The Broker
    is equipped with a Database where the devices
    and the parameter values that they publish on
    the network are stored. The Broker Console
    displays all the information that passes through
    the Server, thus allowing the student to analyse
    in detail the operation of the system.
    MQTT Client
    The DL WORKSPACE also integrates an MQTT
    Client, widely used in carrying out the
    experiments. The Client allows you to connect to
    a Broker and manually set all the commands of
    the MQTT Protocol that allow communication. In
    this way, the student can analyse in detail all the
    characteristics of the protocol which underlies
    the IoT.
    Among other service tools that are used in the exercises we have:
    The Wi-Fi Network Analyzer, which allows detecting
    the networks present in the area of interest and
    checking all the parameters, including the level of the
    signal, the frequencies and the channels used.
    The Network Speed Meter, which allows checking the
    performance of a network in terms of data transfer
    speed.DL NGL
    The Network Packet Analyzer (or Packet Sniffer), a software
    tool that allows capturing and analysing packets traveling on
    a network. This tool is commonly used in network testing
    operations, but can also be used by hackers to capture
    'sensitive' user data.
    All the above tools make the IoT Module an effective tool for studying the Internet of Things and its applications.
    The following notes, taken directly from an exercise in the manual, are an example.
    Suppose we want to study the functioning of an IoT system
    where a 'switch' object (placed anywhere in the world)
    controls a 'lamp' object (placed anywhere else in the world)
    via the Internet of Things.
    The 'real system' that implements the above system, with its components, is shown in the figure.
    Each of the two devices (switch and lamp) must be
    equipped with a Wi-Fi module that transmits or receives
    information from an MQTT server located anywhere on the
    Internet.
    The "switch module" publishes its On/Off status on the
    server via the topic 'OnOff'. The "lamp module" subscribes
    to the switch's 'OnOff' topic on the MQTT server and
    receives its status every time it changes.DL NGL
    The previous 'real system' can be implemented, within the IoT Module of the DL NGL Laboratory, using a
    single workstation. The student uses:
    • a DIGI digital sensor
    • a DIGO on/off actuator
    • a DevIoT Unit, LAN o Wi-Fi connected to its own PC
    • the MQTT Server/Broker on the PC
    All the experiments on the system are widely
    documented in the DL WORKSPACE.
    Use with the Arduino development platform
    The DevIoT Unit is equipped with a Firmware that allows its use in all the applications.
    This firmware provides to:
    • the automatic detection of connected sensors and transducers,
    • the experimentation of the operation of each of them,
    • the connection with an MQTT Broker for the applications related to the Internet of Things,
    • the management of the miniSim with all the exercises,
    • the connection via USB to the computer for parameter setting and supervision operations,
    • the keyboard, display and battery management.
    The STM32F103 Microcontroller can also be programmed via the Arduino Platform, using a serial interface
    (UART) of the microcontroller and a Serial-USB adapter (supplied) for connection to the computer.
    The figure shows the connection of the serial adapter for developing applications with Arduino.DL NGL
    C++ libraries are provided for managing all board resources:
    • 128x64 graphic LCD display,
    • SPI interface with external digital sensors,
    • Ethernet interface,
    • Wi-Fi interface,
    • etc.
    Simple examples of the use of each of the board's functions are also reported in the documentation.

    AUTOTRONICS - DEMONSTRATO
    IGNITION

    Vehicle ignition systems has evolved significantly over the years to deliver improved, more reliable and more powerful performance. The purpose of the ignition system is to generate a very high voltage from the car’s 12V battery, and to send this to each sparkplug in turn, igniting the fuel-air mixture in the engine’s combustion chambers. The coil is the component that produces this high voltage. The widest application for spark ignition internal combustion engines is in petrol (gasoline) road vehicles: cars, four-by-four (SUVs), motorcycles, pickups, vans, trucks and buses. In some modern ignition systems, micro-electronics ensure the optimum ignition timing (the relationship between the exact time a plug is fired and the position of the piston in terms of degrees of crankshaft rotation) for all engine speeds and engine load conditions. For the ignition system field, De Lorenzo has designed some panels to simulate the behavior, with the help of a CAI software, such as the study of the starting techniques used in the Otto cycle engines (conventional, transistor and electronic ignition), the circuits and systems for the starting and the recharging, the techniques and the devices used in the starting systems for industrial vehicles and the electronics applied to ignition systems. Troubleshooting’s are provided in all of them. A demonstrator panel is also available for this category. It represents the operation of the engine ignition system based on real components of six ignition systems for teaching and maintenance training. It is equipped with intelligent fault setting and troubleshooting. They are recommended for professional institutes, vocational schools and technical colleges.

            FLUID MECHANICS 
        FLUID MECHANICS
        Fluid Mechanics studies the laws of motion of fluids and their processes of interaction with solid bodies. Fluid Mechanics is a mixture of theory and experimentation derived from the research of hydraulic engineers, and also from the reflection of mathematicians and physicists, who address problems from an analytical approach. The fundamental characteristic of fluids is the so-called fluidity. A fluid changes shape continuously when subjected to stress, i.e. a fluid is not capable of withstanding a shear stress without moving during any interval of time. Some liquids will move more slowly than others, but under a shear stress they will always move. Fluid mechanics is fundamental in fields as diverse as aeronautics, chemical, civil and industrial engineering, meteorology, shipbuilding and oceanography. With our proposal of didactic systems De Lorenzo seeks to improve, enhance and develop cognitive and social processes in terms of professional competencies integrated by knowledge, skills and attitudes for a comprehensive training of the student in the area of Fluid Mechanics.

        Industrial plant (physical or mechanical) refers to the necessary infrastructure used in operation and maintenance of a given facility. It is an area of general education that deals with technology and industry and should not be confused with “manufacturing plant” in the sense of “a factory”. It is an engineering discipline that includes engineering sciences and optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. The main objective for people within this discipline is to improve efficiency, drive up effectiveness of manufacturing, quality control, and to reduce cost while making their products more attractive and marketable. Industrial engineering is concerned with the development, improvement, and implementation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials, as well as analysis and synthesis. Therefore, industrial engineering is the branch of engineering that involves figuring out how to make or do things better. For this field, De Lorenzo has designed a wide range of industrial plants of modest size, recommended for professional institutes, vocational schools and technical colleges.

            RENEWABLE ENERGIES 

        RENEWABLE ENERGIES
        Renewable energies are the sources of energy based on the use of natural resources: sun, wind, water or plant or animal biomass. They are characterized by not using fossil fuels, but natural resources capable of unlimited renewal. One of their strengths is that they have a very low environmental impact, because in addition to not using finite resources, they do not generate pollutants. With our didactic systems we enable the technician, engineer and specialist in renewable energy, to develop professional skills in the formulation of renewable energy projects through energy diagnostics, establish savings systems, design of innovative solutions and quality of electricity, studies of the natural resources of the environment, to contribute to sustainable development and the rational and efficient use of energy in order to improve the competitiveness of the company where they work and contribute to the sustainable development of the region. With our equipment, teachers will be able to develop skills in Basic Studies, Energy Efficiency, Solar Thermal, Micro Grid, Power Plants, Smart Grid, to name a few. With this proposal, De Lorenzo seeks to improve, enrich, and develop cognitive and social processes in terms of professional competencies made up of knowledge, skills and attitudes for a comprehensive training of the student.

                INTRODUCTION
                Smart building technology is revolutionizing the way we design, manage, and experience buildings.
                By integrating advanced systems, smart buildings offer enhanced efficiency, sustainability, and
                safety. The cutting-edge technologies enable seamless control of lighting, HVAC systems, fire safety,
                and security, while promoting energy optimization and user comfort.
                The “smart building” concept refers to a structure that uses advanced technologies such as sensors,
                actuators, and automation systems to monitor and control building operations and the goal is to
                improve energy efficiency, comfort, safety, and overall building performance.
                This specific lighting system is a cutting-edge training center dedicated to advancing lighting
                technology studies. It uses DALI (Digital Addressable Lighting Interface) technology as the protocol
                for digital lighting control. It is specialized in DALI fundamentals, installation and troubleshooting,
                control and automation, system monitoring and integration, and AI-driven lighting solutions. Its

                DALI is a standardized lighting control system that enables flexible, precise management and
                communication between lighting devices in smart building environments.
                It allows for flexible, digital control of lighting systems, making it ideal for modern smart buildings
                such as:
                 Office buildings with dynamic lighting needs,
                 Smart homes with automated lighting scenes,
                 Hospitals and schools for energy-efficient lighting control,
                 Street lighting systems.
                Regarding “how it works”, a DALI controller sends digital signals over the DALI bus, each DALI device
                listens for commands addressed to it, and the devices can respond with status information or
                execute commands like dimming, switching, or scene recall.
                Here's a diagram illustrating a basic DALI lighting setup.
                TRAINING OBJECTIVES
                This trainer DL SMART-DALI is designed to equip users with comprehensive knowledge and hands-on skills
                in DALI lighting field. It is aimed at a wide audience, including non-experts, highly intuitive and simple to use
                through a user-friendly interface.
                It is flexible enough to meet every need, from the simplest to the most complex, helping the user by
                simplifying and speeding up many of the most common everyday tasks.
                It requires no special care and even in case of failure, it is able to provide the service for which it was designed,
                or a similar one in the case of reduced operation.

                It can be fully configured quickly and intuitively using a software and the system can be accessible from any
                device connected to the same LAN.
                By the end of the training, the users will be able to:
                 Understand the Fundamentals of DALI Lighting.
                 Master DALI System Installation and Troubleshooting.
                 Develop Skills in DALI Control and Automation.
                 Gain Proficiency in DALI System Monitoring and Integration.
                 Apply AI in Lighting Control.
                LABORATORY’S COMPOSITION
                This trainer is composed of a main panel on which all DALI devices (sensors and control gear) are placed.
                Through this panel, the user will perform the DALI configuration, interfacing input devices with DALI devices,
                integrating luminaires into DALI control gear, and accessing the DALI system using the software.
                On this front panel and where the manual settings are made during the installation phase, the users gain
                hands-on experience with real industrial equipment thanks to direct interaction with DALI devices.
                In addition to the operation panel, the system offers a visualization space to better observe the automation
                performance. There is a showroom where the main parts of DALI sensors and luminaires are installed to
                simulate various environments, such as parking lots, outdoor areas, offices, meeting rooms, corridors among
                others.
                Unlike conventional installations where all devices are placed on the same 2D panel, sensors and luminaires
                in the showroom are positioned in a more realistic setting. This enhances the natural occurrence of
                automation and makes its visualization more intuitive.
                The input devices include DALI control panels such as an 8-key push-button panel and a DT8 touch panel to
                enhance the manual control experience. The sensors consist of motion sensors and illuminance sensors. The
                luminaires include single-color LEDs, CCT LEDs, and RGBW LEDs.
                SCADA IN DALI LIGHTING
                SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) is an industrial control system that monitors, gathers, and
                processes real-time data to manage and control equipment and processes across various industries.
                In smart buildings, the BMS (Building Management System) manages and supervises all functional modules.
                When we focus on one functional module, such as the DALI Lighting system, we move to a lower level of
                management and supervision, dealing with critical statuses and decision-making controls of the DALI system.
                In the process of using SCADA, smart building operations management specialists will gain an understanding
                of the key elements they need to monitor within the smart building and its various functional departments,
                enabling them to respond promptly in emergency situations.

        MAINS FEATURES
        According to the different orbits of communication satellites above the earth, they can be divided
        into synchronous and non-synchronous satellite communication systems. This equipment is a
        geosynchronous satellite communication system.
        In addition, there are several frequency band allocations for satellite communications. Among them
        are L-band, C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. This equipment uses the C-band, which is the earliest
        and most widely used.
        It has the following features in C-band:
        • 5.925 ÷ 6.425GHz for transmission,
        • 3.7 ÷ 4.2GHz for reception,
        • 500MHz for sending bandwidth,
        • 500MHz for receiving bandwidth.
        It adopts a modular structure, and all microwave circuits are open and visible to facilitate students'
        intuitive learning.
        It is designed and manufactured according to the secondary frequency conversion scheme common
        to industrial products, to facilitate the students to integrate with reality.
        It can be flexibly combined to be configured for simplex or duplex communication and, depending
        on the terminal equipment, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple
        Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), or Hybrid Multiple Access (HMA) can be

            ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS 

        ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS
        Electrical installations are the set of electrical circuits intended to provide electrical energy to buildings, installations, public places, and infrastructure in general. They include the necessary equipment to ensure their correct operation and the connection with the electrical devices for their operation. Currently, residential, commercial, and industrial electrical installations form the institutional nervous system. They are highly relevant since an inadequate design, faulty installation or poor maintenance can cause anything from the temporary stoppage of company operations to accidents and material damage in the home, business, or company. Most of the fires that occur in each of these environments are caused by failures in electrical installations. At De Lorenzo, we manufacture didactic systems so that technicians, engineers, and electrical specialists are able to develop theoretical-practical experience in the planning, development, and implementation of civil and industrial installations with the use of real industrial-grade components integrated in practical and flexible trainers. Electrical installation laboratories aim to develop cognitive processes and professional competencies comprised of knowledge, skills, and attitudes for comprehensive student training in the fields required by the industry, covering everything, from measurement and protection techniques to the concepts of industrial and home automation.

        ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS
        Electrical installations are the set of electrical circuits intended to provide electrical energy to
        buildings, installations, public places, and infrastructure in general. They include the necessary
        equipment to ensure their correct operation and the connection with the electrical devices for their
        operation.
        Currently, residential, commercial, and industrial electrical installations form the institutional
        nervous system. They are highly relevant since an inadequate design, faulty installation or poor
        maintenance can cause anything from the temporary stoppage of company operations to accidents
        and material damage in the home, business, or company. Most of the fires that occur in each of
        these environments are caused by failures in electrical installations.
        At De Lorenzo, we manufacture didactic systems so that technicians, engineers, and
        electrical specialists are able to develop theoretical-practical experience in the planning,
        development, and implementation of civil and industrial installations with the use of real
        industrial-grade components integrated in practical and flexible trainers.
        Electrical installation laboratories aim to develop cognitive processes and professional
        competencies comprised of knowledge, skills, and attitudes for comprehensive student training
        in the fields required by the industry, covering everything, from measurement and protection
        techniques to the concepts of industrial and home automation.

        De Lorenzo’s products embody a
        synthesis of TECHNICAL,
        PEDAGOGICAL, and DESIGN
        expertise. To effectively facilitate
        knowledge transfer, it is essential
        to consider all of these aspects. In
        the design of educational labs,
        the elements of interaction
        between users and product
        (Design) and between users
        and subject matter (Pedagogy)
        are just as crucial as technical
        knowledge.

        De Lorenzo products embody both the substance of the subjects they teach and
        the tools to teach them. Technology that demonstrates and teaches itself.
        The designers at De Lorenzo
        understand the challenges faced by
        students and educators, striving to
        remove barriers in learning and
        teaching. This commitment ensures

        The products that compose the De Lorenzo laboratories are educational. Therefore,
        the interaction between the user and the product is central. For this reason, De
        Lorenzo products are created in Italy, designed to facilitate the user experience and
        enhanced by didactic manuals and software that simplify teachers' work and
        encourage student learning.
        Colours, international symbology, a clear interface and the ergonomics of the

        De Lorenzo develops teaching equipment that integrates fundamental
        pedagogical principles such as simulation of real challenges, repetition,
        imitation and playfulness. The laboratories support teachers in creating
        captivating lessons, keeping students' attention high.
        The laboratories facilitate the application of these principles, but do not replace the
        teachers' skills. For this reason, De Lorenzo trains teachers through its Academy,
        enabling them to exploit the products’ potential to the fullest, even creating new
        experiments in addition to those in the manuals. In fact, De Lorenzo's products are
        open and allow the exercises to be extended.

        CIVIL INSTALLATIONS KIT
        An electrical plant indicates, in the field of electrical engineering, the set of electrical, mechanical and physical equipment suitable for transmission and use of electrical energy. The professional figure that deals with the creation and maintenance of these systems is that of the electrician and the civil electrical installations plants are one of the largest categories. They are used in private homes and public access places such as schools and hospitals. De Lorenzo, for this category, has designed different trainers in two versions; one having modular structure of didactic panels, with symbols and diagrams, arranged on a vertical frame and another having workbench structure with panels and kits targeted to installers. The topics covered in the civil electrical installations are basic and advanced lighting plants, signaling plant, house phones plant, hotels/hospital plants, fire and intruder alarm plants, video intercom plant and a large number of installation kits with all the necessary accessories to make any need available. They are recommended for installers and high schools.

            FACTORY” ENHANCED WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
            DL I4.0 FACTORY-AI
            Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing the manufacturing sector by
            integrating advanced technologies to create "smart factories”.
            The digitization of information, combined with high-performance hardware and AI technologies,
            enables the implementation of more flexible and optimized production architectures. The level of
            innovation is such that today, Industry 4.0 is synonymous with intelligent manufacturing, and the
            adjective "smart" refers to integrated information management, enhanced by AI and digital
            technology.
            This proposed educational system reproduces a collaborative environment to study concepts related
            to Industry 4.0 enhanced with AI, integrating small-scale subsystems commonly found in a
            manufacturing plant. It is composed of a set of electronic boards, real hardware simulators and
            software to study the different subsystems that can be found in a real production line. The students,
            using an open-source microcontroller connected to SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition)
            software for data acquisition, will be able to perform activities covering topics on introduction to
            automation and robotics, communication protocols (IoT), sensors and actuators and complete study
            of a productive system related to Industry 4.0.
            The added DL AI-MODULE to this system uses the SCADA data to enhance operational efficiency
            across key areas. It predicts equipment failures with predictive maintenance, detects real-time
            anomalies, optimizes production processes, automates quality control, forecasts energy consumption,
            and improves supply chain management.
            In today’s rapidly evolving industrial landscape, leveraging data to enhance operational efficiency and
            predict potential issues is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. The DL AI-MODULE focuses
            on the application of advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize various aspects

            PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
            In the didactic laboratory for the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions, the challenge-based
            learning (CBL) approach focuses on providing students with practical, real-world challenges that allow
            them to apply theoretical knowledge in specific situations. Rather than simply presenting information
            passively, this approach engages students in solving problems and creating innovative solutions.
            Students are faced with challenges that simulate real-life and industry problems, such as process
            optimization, anomaly detection or efficiency improvement. Using the hardware and software available
            in the lab, as well as artificial intelligence tools, students work in teams to develop practical solutions that
            address these challenges.

            INTRODUCTION TO AUTOMATION 4.0 AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
            Industry 4.0 is now a reality, revolutionizing production facilities around the world. To fully exploit its
            potential, technicians with expertise in software engineering and automation are increasingly essential, and
            professionals with interdisciplinary skills are needed more than ever, Industry 4.0 thrives on the generation,
            storage, analysis and application of data for decision making, which requires specialized software.
            Technicians must understand software engineering to manage systems and automation engineering to
            understand industrial architectures and optimize the use of data. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
            beginning to transform industrial processes by addressing needs that were traditionally met with sensors and
            human intervention. Although AI is poised to replace certain algorithms and sensors, this change is limited
            by the shortage of professionals who can bring together automation and software to develop Artificial
            Intelligence (Machine Learning, Neural Networks, etc.) for industrial applications, The laboratory for the
            development of artificial intelligence (the product) aims to close this gap by training software engineers with
            essential knowledge of automation and mechatronics, and vice versa.

                Introduction

                The courses presented at Northlink College are career-orientated to bridge the gap between the workshop and the world of work with the least disruption at the end of the training period. Students who attend the simulated training are expected to wear the required safety attire (Helmet, Safety Shoes and an overall) at all times. The Competency Based Modular Training (CBMT) is the first stage in your career path that will allow the student to attain artisan status by successfully completing a trade test, after the prescribed work-based (on-site) experience accredited by the MERSETA, MAPPSETA, CHIETA, ESETA, AgriSETA. Note that the mentioned SETAs has the authority to approve your work-based experience.
