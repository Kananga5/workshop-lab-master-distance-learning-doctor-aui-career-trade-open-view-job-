    LABS
    DL NGL-CLOUD
    Module for the study of cloud computingDL NGL
    The 'Cloud Computing' module contains devices and tools for analysing and experimenting at an educational
    level with this latest generation information technology that allows managing processing resources on
    remote devices, connected to the Internet, which allow for global use of the contents.
    The Cloud Computing paradigm is gaining more and more ground in corporate IT innovation, as it allows
    renting processing resources "on demand", without the need to manage the necessary machines (servers)
    on site, reducing maintenance costs (breakage of hardware components, addition of processing resources
    such as CPU, RAM or mass memory) and allowing a use of resources suited to the application they must
    support.
    Further advantages are the possibility of
    increasing resources the instant they are needed
    (e.g., due to a sudden increase in the workload
    generated by a traffic burst) and being able to
    reduce them the instant they are no longer
    needed, ensuring cost savings.
    This "abstraction" of cloud computing also
    makes it possible not to have to keep the physical
    machines directly on site, reducing the times in
    which the application is offline due to failures of
    the infrastructure or of the machines
    themselves.
    The Module allows configuring and using a private Cloud Computing system within the Laboratory.
    It consists of a Server equipped with all the necessary software components:
    • Preconfigured physical server
    • Physical hardware
    • Ubuntu Operating System
    • Apache CloudStack cloud computing platform and its software requirements
    • Open Office, MySQL Database
    The resources of this server can be accessed autonomously from the laboratory workstations, using a
    browser (e.g., Google Chrome) to connect to the Apache CloudStack web interface.
    There is also a command prompt with SSH connection capability: Putty for Windows environment.
    This solution of implementing a physical Server inside the Laboratory, instead of using Servers available
    online on the Internet with their Cloud Computing services, certainly has positive aspects both in terms of
    performance and, in the medium and long term, in terms of costs avoiding the burden of periodic payment
    for the service.DL NGL
    CloudStack allows configuring Virtual Machines, which reside on the Server, but which are used by Remote
    Users. For each machine you can set resources such as: number of cores, memory, disk space, etc.
    The activity of all Virtual Machines is controlled on the server, in real time, using the appropriate CloudStack
    tools.
    Once users of the system have connected to one of the Virtual Machines, they can work on them as if they
    were computers on their workstation. It works with the Ubuntu Operating System and with all its individual
    productivity tools: Editor, Spreadsheet, database, etc.

    DL NGL-CIMSIM
    Module for the study of a conveyor beltDL NGL
    The design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems is an essential technique in the
    field of electronic engineering and computer engineering.
    With this board system, students can study the properties of a conveyor belt used in industrial environments.
    Sensors and actuators are included for the development of a complete course on the main characteristics of
    conveying systems and their applications.
    The system is equipped with SCADA software for studying automation and industry 4.0 concepts and can be
    combined with the other simulators of the family to simulate a simplified industrial 4.0 factory.
    The system for studying a conveyor belt consists of two main elements:

    boards include all the components, sensors, and actuators needed to understand and manage the
    operation of a conveyor belt.
    • A real hardware simulator of a conveyor belt used in industrial environments. Through this simulator,
    the student will be able to learn how to operate and control a production line through the use of a PLC
    and an open-source microcontroller. Its structure allows the connection of the components included in
    the board kit, making them compatible with each other.
    The integration of the belt conveyor system in an industrial process is possible through a SCADA software,
    which allows a study on the concept of automation and Industry 4.0.
    With the card and the respective simulator, the DL NGL interacts through a gateway software allowing the
    passage of information between devices that use different communication protocols, guaranteeing the
    compatibility between them by their interoperability and by providing a common interface for their
    communication. The end user can monitor, interact, acquire, and analyse the data generated by interactions
    to manage and optimize the entire industrial process.DL NGL

    DL NGL-CYBER
    Module for the study of cybersecurityDL NGL
    The 'Cybersecurity' module has been developed for the study of the problems relating to the security of
    devices, networks and systems.
    It addresses the various issues starting from a complete analysis of the OSI model, providing the student with
    a holistic view of security which he can then apply to the various areas in which he will operate.
    In fact, the OSI model is an essential tool, not only for understanding how a network works, but also for
    understanding where cyber threats arise and what steps to take to eliminate them.
    Data within networks travel through various layers represented by the OSI Model and, at each layer, there
    are different types of vulnerabilities.
    To comprehensively address network vulnerability issues, action must be taken at every level.
    Security issues at various levels include:
    protection against unwanted physical access,
    ARP spoofing, unwanted data access, capture of
    personal information such as identifiers and
    passwords, worms and viruses.
    The security tools and solutions used include:
    physical access restriction, private Virtual LAN,
    Firewalls, information encryption, network user
    authentication, anti-virus tools.
    The Module consists of a series of software tools,
    which integrate with the DL WORKSPACE, which
    allow the study and experimentation at the
    different levels of the OSI model on security
    issues: Servers, Clients, Packet Analyzers,
    Network Analyzers, etc.
    Practical exercises are included, such as the one that simulates a 'man in the middle' type attack, where a
    hacker places himself between a Client and a Server and, capturing the communication packets that pass on
    the network, is able to steal sensitive information such as identifiers and passwords.
    The solution to this type of attack is to encrypt the data with a secret key before sending it over the network.DL NGL
    The DL WORKSPACE contains the encryption tools for
    performing these kinds of hands-on experiences.
    Other fundamental experiences for learning
    Cybersecurity issues are those relating to the Firewalls
    contained in the Routers of home computer networks,
    which protect home networks from unwanted access.
    Firewalls are hardware and software devices designed
    to protect our private networks from intrusion by
    strangers while connected to the Internet.
    It is, therefore, necessary to pay the utmost attention to
    the configuration of the Router: in the event that some
    'chink' is left open, a hacker could exploit it to access
    devices and personal data.
    The Module contains Routers to perform Firewall
    configuration exercises to optimize the security level of
    your home networks.

    DL NGL-DATA
    Module for the study of big dataDL NGL
    The 'Big Data' module deals with the study of the processing and analysis of large amounts of data in the
    context of Data Science.
    Big Data differs from traditional data collections in several characteristics: the amount of data, the fact that
    data is generally unstructured because it comes from different sources and forms and, in the case of real
    time streaming, the speed with which the data arrives.
    New technologies have been introduced in Data Science that deal with the management and analysis of large
    data, overcoming the limitations of traditional data management systems such as relational DBMS (Database
    Management System).
    The ‘Big Data’ module uses Apache Spark, an open-source framework that supports in-memory parallel
    computing to optimize the performance of applications that analyse Big Data.
    It is used by a great many organizations around the world, including IBM, NASA, Samsung and Yahoo!, and
    its use is constantly expanding.
    Within the Module, simple applications will be
    developed using the Python programming
    language.
    The 'Big Data' module addresses the main issues
    of big data processing with an informative
    approach and with practical exercises that make
    learning more effective.
    The data that is analysed can be of different types:
    structured, semi-structured or unstructured. The
    most common structures in Apache Spark are:
    DataFrame, dataset and RDD (Resilient
    Distributed Dataset).
    The analysis of Big Data often has the objective of
    making predictions or deriving any strategies for
    users based on the available data.
    For advanced analysis and Machine Learning-type processing, the Spark MLib library is used, which allows
    performing preliminary data analyses, implementing regression and classification models, making
    predictions, but also clustering.
    In fact, it provides various algorithms, such as those for linear regression, the K-means method, the random
    forests, etc.
    The Module will examine different processing techniques with different purposes, for example, Supervised
    Learning in which, starting from historical data, we will try to train a model to predict future data through an
    iterative optimization algorithm.DL NGL
    Or, the Unsupervised Learning, where you try to find
    patterns or discover the underlying structure in a set
    of data.
    This methodology is particularly indicated in the
    search for anomalies, but it is also very useful in
    marketing, to carry out segmentation and, therefore,
    identify groups that are as homogeneous internally
    and heterogeneous as possible.
    Finally, the processing of data represented by graphs,
    graph operators, graph algorithms, graph builders and
    other techniques are examined. A graph is a set of
    nodes (or vertices) connected to each other through
    arcs and can be used to represent, for example, the
    friendship network in a social network where the
    nodes are people while the arcs represent friendships.
    Spark's GraphX library provides algorithms for
    measuring the importance of a node, the presence of
    any hubs, calculating connected components,
    calculating triangles, etc.
    Most of the practical exercises will be carried out on
    real data taken from the site www.kaggle.com, which
    contains datasets accessible to all and of different
    formats.

    DL NGL-IOT
    Module for the study of the Internet of ThingsDL NGL
    The term "Internet of Things" identifies a system in which not only people are able to connect to a Global
    Network, but also the most common objects.
    These objects can be seen and controlled both by other
    objects and by network users.
    There is no limitation to the type of object that can be
    connected, thus providing the Internet of Things with
    an unlimited space of applications: industry, home
    automation, medicine, etc.
    The 'IoT' Module adds to the Basic Module the devices and tools for the study and learning of all topics related
    to the Internet of Things.
    With this module you can acquire skills on all issues related to the IoT world:
    • Characteristics and performance of the devices to be connected: sensors, actuators, etc.
    • Communication technologies: protocols, networks, etc.
    • Information technologies:server, database, client, etc.
    • Analysis of performance, safety, etc. of the system.
    The Module consists of devices and tools to set up a complete IoT system, where to carry out all the exercises
    and experiments:
    • DevIoT Unit, with sensors, actuators and connection interfaces to wired and wireless networks. It is
    supplied with Firmware for immediate use, but it is also programmable via the Arduino development
    platform to allow users to develop customized applications.
    • IoT Server and Client (with MQTT protocol).
    • Service toolsfor testing and functional analysis: protocol analysers, Wi-Fi analysers, network traffic meters,
    etc.
    The figure shows the laboratory network and how the devices of the IoT Module find their space within it to
    provide a complete system that represents a real IoT application.
    The IoT Module can be integrated with the miniSim series Simulators that allow studying different IoT
    applications:
    • Energy
    • Agriculture
    • Chemistry
    • Biomedical
    • Manufacturing
    • Automotive
    Through the tools made available, they reproduce complete IoT systems in a single workstation, in an 'open'
    form, where the student can therefore interact independently with the different parts of the system in
    learning operations, at any level.DL NGL
    Devices and tools are described below.

    MQTT (IoT) Broker and Client and Service Tools
    An IoT application is basically a 'distributed' application. where the various components of the system
    (sensors, servers, clients, actuators, etc.), located in different places, communicate with each other through
    the Internet. Reproposing distributed systems of this type at an educational level, where the student, in order
    to be able to learn, must see inside the system how information passes from one component to another, is
    impossible using directly Servers available online on the Internet with their hosting services. For this reason,
    the IoT Module is equipped with software to implement IoT Server (Broker) and Client, integrated in the DL
    WORKSPACE environment, and, therefore, usable on all workstations.
    All this allows each Student, with the resources of his own workstation, to set up a complete IoT System and
    to experiment on it at any level. He is, therefore, enabled to learn the various problems that underlie systems
    of this type, working autonomously on his own workstation and proceeding at his own learning speed.DL NGL
    MQTT Broker
    DL WORKSPACE provides an MQTT Broker for all
    exercises related to the IoT. This is the
    indispensable tool for connecting the various
    devices of the system to each other. The Broker
    is equipped with a Database where the devices
    and the parameter values that they publish on
    the network are stored. The Broker Console
    displays all the information that passes through
    the Server, thus allowing the student to analyse
    in detail the operation of the system.
    MQTT Client
    The DL WORKSPACE also integrates an MQTT
    Client, widely used in carrying out the
    experiments. The Client allows you to connect to
    a Broker and manually set all the commands of
    the MQTT Protocol that allow communication. In
    this way, the student can analyse in detail all the
    characteristics of the protocol which underlies
    the IoT.
    Among other service tools that are used in the exercises we have:
    The Wi-Fi Network Analyzer, which allows detecting
    the networks present in the area of interest and
    checking all the parameters, including the level of the
    signal, the frequencies and the channels used.
    The Network Speed Meter, which allows checking the
    performance of a network in terms of data transfer
    speed.DL NGL
    The Network Packet Analyzer (or Packet Sniffer), a software
    tool that allows capturing and analysing packets traveling on
    a network. This tool is commonly used in network testing
    operations, but can also be used by hackers to capture
    'sensitive' user data.
    All the above tools make the IoT Module an effective tool for studying the Internet of Things and its applications.
    The following notes, taken directly from an exercise in the manual, are an example.
    Suppose we want to study the functioning of an IoT system
    where a 'switch' object (placed anywhere in the world)
    controls a 'lamp' object (placed anywhere else in the world)
    via the Internet of Things.
    The 'real system' that implements the above system, with its components, is shown in the figure.
    Each of the two devices (switch and lamp) must be
    equipped with a Wi-Fi module that transmits or receives
    information from an MQTT server located anywhere on the
    Internet.
    The "switch module" publishes its On/Off status on the
    server via the topic 'OnOff'. The "lamp module" subscribes
    to the switch's 'OnOff' topic on the MQTT server and
    receives its status every time it changes.DL NGL
    The previous 'real system' can be implemented, within the IoT Module of the DL NGL Laboratory, using a
    single workstation. The student uses:
    • a DIGI digital sensor
    • a DIGO on/off actuator
    • a DevIoT Unit, LAN o Wi-Fi connected to its own PC
    • the MQTT Server/Broker on the PC
    All the experiments on the system are widely
    documented in the DL WORKSPACE.
    Use with the Arduino development platform
    The DevIoT Unit is equipped with a Firmware that allows its use in all the applications.
    This firmware provides to:
    • the automatic detection of connected sensors and transducers,
    • the experimentation of the operation of each of them,
    • the connection with an MQTT Broker for the applications related to the Internet of Things,
    • the management of the miniSim with all the exercises,
    • the connection via USB to the computer for parameter setting and supervision operations,
    • the keyboard, display and battery management.
    The STM32F103 Microcontroller can also be programmed via the Arduino Platform, using a serial interface
    (UART) of the microcontroller and a Serial-USB adapter (supplied) for connection to the computer.
    The figure shows the connection of the serial adapter for developing applications with Arduino.DL NGL
    C++ libraries are provided for managing all board resources:
    • 128x64 graphic LCD display,
    • SPI interface with external digital sensors,
    • Ethernet interface,
    • Wi-Fi interface,
    • etc.
    Simple examples of the use of each of the board's functions are also reported in the documentation.

    AUTOTRONICS - DEMONSTRATO
    IGNITION

    Vehicle ignition systems has evolved significantly over the years to deliver improved, more reliable and more powerful performance. The purpose of the ignition system is to generate a very high voltage from the car’s 12V battery, and to send this to each sparkplug in turn, igniting the fuel-air mixture in the engine’s combustion chambers. The coil is the component that produces this high voltage. The widest application for spark ignition internal combustion engines is in petrol (gasoline) road vehicles: cars, four-by-four (SUVs), motorcycles, pickups, vans, trucks and buses. In some modern ignition systems, micro-electronics ensure the optimum ignition timing (the relationship between the exact time a plug is fired and the position of the piston in terms of degrees of crankshaft rotation) for all engine speeds and engine load conditions. For the ignition system field, De Lorenzo has designed some panels to simulate the behavior, with the help of a CAI software, such as the study of the starting techniques used in the Otto cycle engines (conventional, transistor and electronic ignition), the circuits and systems for the starting and the recharging, the techniques and the devices used in the starting systems for industrial vehicles and the electronics applied to ignition systems. Troubleshooting’s are provided in all of them. A demonstrator panel is also available for this category. It represents the operation of the engine ignition system based on real components of six ignition systems for teaching and maintenance training. It is equipped with intelligent fault setting and troubleshooting. They are recommended for professional institutes, vocational schools and technical colleges.

            FLUID MECHANICS 
        FLUID MECHANICS
        Fluid Mechanics studies the laws of motion of fluids and their processes of interaction with solid bodies. Fluid Mechanics is a mixture of theory and experimentation derived from the research of hydraulic engineers, and also from the reflection of mathematicians and physicists, who address problems from an analytical approach. The fundamental characteristic of fluids is the so-called fluidity. A fluid changes shape continuously when subjected to stress, i.e. a fluid is not capable of withstanding a shear stress without moving during any interval of time. Some liquids will move more slowly than others, but under a shear stress they will always move. Fluid mechanics is fundamental in fields as diverse as aeronautics, chemical, civil and industrial engineering, meteorology, shipbuilding and oceanography. With our proposal of didactic systems De Lorenzo seeks to improve, enhance and develop cognitive and social processes in terms of professional competencies integrated by knowledge, skills and attitudes for a comprehensive training of the student in the area of Fluid Mechanics.

        Industrial plant (physical or mechanical) refers to the necessary infrastructure used in operation and maintenance of a given facility. It is an area of general education that deals with technology and industry and should not be confused with “manufacturing plant” in the sense of “a factory”. It is an engineering discipline that includes engineering sciences and optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. The main objective for people within this discipline is to improve efficiency, drive up effectiveness of manufacturing, quality control, and to reduce cost while making their products more attractive and marketable. Industrial engineering is concerned with the development, improvement, and implementation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials, as well as analysis and synthesis. Therefore, industrial engineering is the branch of engineering that involves figuring out how to make or do things better. For this field, De Lorenzo has designed a wide range of industrial plants of modest size, recommended for professional institutes, vocational schools and technical colleges.

            RENEWABLE ENERGIES 

        RENEWABLE ENERGIES
        Renewable energies are the sources of energy based on the use of natural resources: sun, wind, water or plant or animal biomass. They are characterized by not using fossil fuels, but natural resources capable of unlimited renewal. One of their strengths is that they have a very low environmental impact, because in addition to not using finite resources, they do not generate pollutants. With our didactic systems we enable the technician, engineer and specialist in renewable energy, to develop professional skills in the formulation of renewable energy projects through energy diagnostics, establish savings systems, design of innovative solutions and quality of electricity, studies of the natural resources of the environment, to contribute to sustainable development and the rational and efficient use of energy in order to improve the competitiveness of the company where they work and contribute to the sustainable development of the region. With our equipment, teachers will be able to develop skills in Basic Studies, Energy Efficiency, Solar Thermal, Micro Grid, Power Plants, Smart Grid, to name a few. With this proposal, De Lorenzo seeks to improve, enrich, and develop cognitive and social processes in terms of professional competencies made up of knowledge, skills and attitudes for a comprehensive training of the student.

                INTRODUCTION
                Smart building technology is revolutionizing the way we design, manage, and experience buildings.
                By integrating advanced systems, smart buildings offer enhanced efficiency, sustainability, and
                safety. The cutting-edge technologies enable seamless control of lighting, HVAC systems, fire safety,
                and security, while promoting energy optimization and user comfort.
                The “smart building” concept refers to a structure that uses advanced technologies such as sensors,
                actuators, and automation systems to monitor and control building operations and the goal is to
                improve energy efficiency, comfort, safety, and overall building performance.
                This specific lighting system is a cutting-edge training center dedicated to advancing lighting
                technology studies. It uses DALI (Digital Addressable Lighting Interface) technology as the protocol
                for digital lighting control. It is specialized in DALI fundamentals, installation and troubleshooting,
                control and automation, system monitoring and integration, and AI-driven lighting solutions. Its

                DALI is a standardized lighting control system that enables flexible, precise management and
                communication between lighting devices in smart building environments.
                It allows for flexible, digital control of lighting systems, making it ideal for modern smart buildings
                such as:
                 Office buildings with dynamic lighting needs,
                 Smart homes with automated lighting scenes,
                 Hospitals and schools for energy-efficient lighting control,
                 Street lighting systems.
                Regarding “how it works”, a DALI controller sends digital signals over the DALI bus, each DALI device
                listens for commands addressed to it, and the devices can respond with status information or
                execute commands like dimming, switching, or scene recall.
                Here's a diagram illustrating a basic DALI lighting setup.
                TRAINING OBJECTIVES
                This trainer DL SMART-DALI is designed to equip users with comprehensive knowledge and hands-on skills
                in DALI lighting field. It is aimed at a wide audience, including non-experts, highly intuitive and simple to use
                through a user-friendly interface.
                It is flexible enough to meet every need, from the simplest to the most complex, helping the user by
                simplifying and speeding up many of the most common everyday tasks.
                It requires no special care and even in case of failure, it is able to provide the service for which it was designed,
                or a similar one in the case of reduced operation.

                It can be fully configured quickly and intuitively using a software and the system can be accessible from any
                device connected to the same LAN.
                By the end of the training, the users will be able to:
                 Understand the Fundamentals of DALI Lighting.
                 Master DALI System Installation and Troubleshooting.
                 Develop Skills in DALI Control and Automation.
                 Gain Proficiency in DALI System Monitoring and Integration.
                 Apply AI in Lighting Control.
                LABORATORY’S COMPOSITION
                This trainer is composed of a main panel on which all DALI devices (sensors and control gear) are placed.
                Through this panel, the user will perform the DALI configuration, interfacing input devices with DALI devices,
                integrating luminaires into DALI control gear, and accessing the DALI system using the software.
                On this front panel and where the manual settings are made during the installation phase, the users gain
                hands-on experience with real industrial equipment thanks to direct interaction with DALI devices.
                In addition to the operation panel, the system offers a visualization space to better observe the automation
                performance. There is a showroom where the main parts of DALI sensors and luminaires are installed to
                simulate various environments, such as parking lots, outdoor areas, offices, meeting rooms, corridors among
                others.
                Unlike conventional installations where all devices are placed on the same 2D panel, sensors and luminaires
                in the showroom are positioned in a more realistic setting. This enhances the natural occurrence of
                automation and makes its visualization more intuitive.
                The input devices include DALI control panels such as an 8-key push-button panel and a DT8 touch panel to
                enhance the manual control experience. The sensors consist of motion sensors and illuminance sensors. The
                luminaires include single-color LEDs, CCT LEDs, and RGBW LEDs.
                SCADA IN DALI LIGHTING
                SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) is an industrial control system that monitors, gathers, and
                processes real-time data to manage and control equipment and processes across various industries.
                In smart buildings, the BMS (Building Management System) manages and supervises all functional modules.
                When we focus on one functional module, such as the DALI Lighting system, we move to a lower level of
                management and supervision, dealing with critical statuses and decision-making controls of the DALI system.
                In the process of using SCADA, smart building operations management specialists will gain an understanding
                of the key elements they need to monitor within the smart building and its various functional departments,
                enabling them to respond promptly in emergency situations.

        MAINS FEATURES
        According to the different orbits of communication satellites above the earth, they can be divided
        into synchronous and non-synchronous satellite communication systems. This equipment is a
        geosynchronous satellite communication system.
        In addition, there are several frequency band allocations for satellite communications. Among them
        are L-band, C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. This equipment uses the C-band, which is the earliest
        and most widely used.
        It has the following features in C-band:
        • 5.925 ÷ 6.425GHz for transmission,
        • 3.7 ÷ 4.2GHz for reception,
        • 500MHz for sending bandwidth,
        • 500MHz for receiving bandwidth.
        It adopts a modular structure, and all microwave circuits are open and visible to facilitate students'
        intuitive learning.
        It is designed and manufactured according to the secondary frequency conversion scheme common
        to industrial products, to facilitate the students to integrate with reality.
        It can be flexibly combined to be configured for simplex or duplex communication and, depending
        on the terminal equipment, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple
        Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), or Hybrid Multiple Access (HMA) can be

            ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS 

        ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS
        Electrical installations are the set of electrical circuits intended to provide electrical energy to buildings, installations, public places, and infrastructure in general. They include the necessary equipment to ensure their correct operation and the connection with the electrical devices for their operation. Currently, residential, commercial, and industrial electrical installations form the institutional nervous system. They are highly relevant since an inadequate design, faulty installation or poor maintenance can cause anything from the temporary stoppage of company operations to accidents and material damage in the home, business, or company. Most of the fires that occur in each of these environments are caused by failures in electrical installations. At De Lorenzo, we manufacture didactic systems so that technicians, engineers, and electrical specialists are able to develop theoretical-practical experience in the planning, development, and implementation of civil and industrial installations with the use of real industrial-grade components integrated in practical and flexible trainers. Electrical installation laboratories aim to develop cognitive processes and professional competencies comprised of knowledge, skills, and attitudes for comprehensive student training in the fields required by the industry, covering everything, from measurement and protection techniques to the concepts of industrial and home automation.

        ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS
        Electrical installations are the set of electrical circuits intended to provide electrical energy to
        buildings, installations, public places, and infrastructure in general. They include the necessary
        equipment to ensure their correct operation and the connection with the electrical devices for their
        operation.
        Currently, residential, commercial, and industrial electrical installations form the institutional
        nervous system. They are highly relevant since an inadequate design, faulty installation or poor
        maintenance can cause anything from the temporary stoppage of company operations to accidents
        and material damage in the home, business, or company. Most of the fires that occur in each of
        these environments are caused by failures in electrical installations.
        At De Lorenzo, we manufacture didactic systems so that technicians, engineers, and
        electrical specialists are able to develop theoretical-practical experience in the planning,
        development, and implementation of civil and industrial installations with the use of real
        industrial-grade components integrated in practical and flexible trainers.
        Electrical installation laboratories aim to develop cognitive processes and professional
        competencies comprised of knowledge, skills, and attitudes for comprehensive student training
        in the fields required by the industry, covering everything, from measurement and protection
        techniques to the concepts of industrial and home automation.

        De Lorenzo’s products embody a
        synthesis of TECHNICAL,
        PEDAGOGICAL, and DESIGN
        expertise. To effectively facilitate
        knowledge transfer, it is essential
        to consider all of these aspects. In
        the design of educational labs,
        the elements of interaction
        between users and product
        (Design) and between users
        and subject matter (Pedagogy)
        are just as crucial as technical
        knowledge.

        De Lorenzo products embody both the substance of the subjects they teach and
        the tools to teach them. Technology that demonstrates and teaches itself.
        The designers at De Lorenzo
        understand the challenges faced by
        students and educators, striving to
        remove barriers in learning and
        teaching. This commitment ensures

        The products that compose the De Lorenzo laboratories are educational. Therefore,
        the interaction between the user and the product is central. For this reason, De
        Lorenzo products are created in Italy, designed to facilitate the user experience and
        enhanced by didactic manuals and software that simplify teachers' work and
        encourage student learning.
        Colours, international symbology, a clear interface and the ergonomics of the

        De Lorenzo develops teaching equipment that integrates fundamental
        pedagogical principles such as simulation of real challenges, repetition,
        imitation and playfulness. The laboratories support teachers in creating
        captivating lessons, keeping students' attention high.
        The laboratories facilitate the application of these principles, but do not replace the
        teachers' skills. For this reason, De Lorenzo trains teachers through its Academy,
        enabling them to exploit the products’ potential to the fullest, even creating new
        experiments in addition to those in the manuals. In fact, De Lorenzo's products are
        open and allow the exercises to be extended.

        CIVIL INSTALLATIONS KIT
        An electrical plant indicates, in the field of electrical engineering, the set of electrical, mechanical and physical equipment suitable for transmission and use of electrical energy. The professional figure that deals with the creation and maintenance of these systems is that of the electrician and the civil electrical installations plants are one of the largest categories. They are used in private homes and public access places such as schools and hospitals. De Lorenzo, for this category, has designed different trainers in two versions; one having modular structure of didactic panels, with symbols and diagrams, arranged on a vertical frame and another having workbench structure with panels and kits targeted to installers. The topics covered in the civil electrical installations are basic and advanced lighting plants, signaling plant, house phones plant, hotels/hospital plants, fire and intruder alarm plants, video intercom plant and a large number of installation kits with all the necessary accessories to make any need available. They are recommended for installers and high schools.

            FACTORY” ENHANCED WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
            DL I4.0 FACTORY-AI
            Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing the manufacturing sector by
            integrating advanced technologies to create "smart factories”.
            The digitization of information, combined with high-performance hardware and AI technologies,
            enables the implementation of more flexible and optimized production architectures. The level of
            innovation is such that today, Industry 4.0 is synonymous with intelligent manufacturing, and the
            adjective "smart" refers to integrated information management, enhanced by AI and digital
            technology.
            This proposed educational system reproduces a collaborative environment to study concepts related
            to Industry 4.0 enhanced with AI, integrating small-scale subsystems commonly found in a
            manufacturing plant. It is composed of a set of electronic boards, real hardware simulators and
            software to study the different subsystems that can be found in a real production line. The students,
            using an open-source microcontroller connected to SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition)
            software for data acquisition, will be able to perform activities covering topics on introduction to
            automation and robotics, communication protocols (IoT), sensors and actuators and complete study
            of a productive system related to Industry 4.0.
            The added DL AI-MODULE to this system uses the SCADA data to enhance operational efficiency
            across key areas. It predicts equipment failures with predictive maintenance, detects real-time
            anomalies, optimizes production processes, automates quality control, forecasts energy consumption,
            and improves supply chain management.
            In today’s rapidly evolving industrial landscape, leveraging data to enhance operational efficiency and
            predict potential issues is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. The DL AI-MODULE focuses
            on the application of advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize various aspects

            PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
            In the didactic laboratory for the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions, the challenge-based
            learning (CBL) approach focuses on providing students with practical, real-world challenges that allow
            them to apply theoretical knowledge in specific situations. Rather than simply presenting information
            passively, this approach engages students in solving problems and creating innovative solutions.
            Students are faced with challenges that simulate real-life and industry problems, such as process
            optimization, anomaly detection or efficiency improvement. Using the hardware and software available
            in the lab, as well as artificial intelligence tools, students work in teams to develop practical solutions that
            address these challenges.

            INTRODUCTION TO AUTOMATION 4.0 AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
            Industry 4.0 is now a reality, revolutionizing production facilities around the world. To fully exploit its
            potential, technicians with expertise in software engineering and automation are increasingly essential, and
            professionals with interdisciplinary skills are needed more than ever, Industry 4.0 thrives on the generation,
            storage, analysis and application of data for decision making, which requires specialized software.
            Technicians must understand software engineering to manage systems and automation engineering to
            understand industrial architectures and optimize the use of data. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
            beginning to transform industrial processes by addressing needs that were traditionally met with sensors and
            human intervention. Although AI is poised to replace certain algorithms and sensors, this change is limited
            by the shortage of professionals who can bring together automation and software to develop Artificial
            Intelligence (Machine Learning, Neural Networks, etc.) for industrial applications, The laboratory for the
            development of artificial intelligence (the product) aims to close this gap by training software engineers with
            essential knowledge of automation and mechatronics, and vice versa.

                Introduction

                The courses presented at Northlink College are career-orientated to bridge the gap between the workshop and the world of work with the least disruption at the end of the training period. Students who attend the simulated training are expected to wear the required safety attire (Helmet, Safety Shoes and an overall) at all times. The Competency Based Modular Training (CBMT) is the first stage in your career path that will allow the student to attain artisan status by successfully completing a trade test, after the prescribed work-based (on-site) experience accredited by the MERSETA, MAPPSETA, CHIETA, ESETA, AgriSETA. Note that the mentioned SETAs has the authority to approve your work-based experience.

Chapter 1.01: What is Artificial Intelligence?
Understanding the fundamentals of AI
Introduction Defining AI AI Intelligence Turing Test Everyday AI 
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, or AI, has become a buzzword you might have heard recently through social media, in conversations, or even on TV. However, it is not new. In fact, you have been using AI for years and might not even realize it.
AI has evolved from a new concept to a technology integrated into our daily lives.
At times, AI is portrayed as a force capable of changing the way we live, work, and interact. But beyond the hype, AI is a tool that has been evolving over decades, shaped by the contributions of countless individuals across various fields.
And AI is not just for those who work with technology—it is for all of us. Understanding the fundamentals of artificial intelligence helps demystify this increasingly important technology and empowers us to engage with it more effectively.
Defining Artificial Intelligence
What is AI?
AI is the ability of a computer system to learn from past data and errors, enabling it to make increasingly accurate predictions for future behavior.
This encompasses a broad range of activities, such as problem-solving, speech recognition, learning, and decision-making. AI systems can process and analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions that would be difficult or impossible for humans to discern.
AI encompasses problem-solving, speech recognition, and innovative thinking.
What Makes AI "Intelligent"?
So, what makes AI 'intelligent'? At its core, AI is the intelligence demonstrated by software or machines in performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
These tasks can include recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions. For example, when you interact with Siri on your mobile phone, it is not exhibiting intelligence in the same way a human would.
Rather, humans have programmed it to respond to certain prompts and execute functions, such as providing the latest weather update in your area or letting you know your local news.
A chess-playing AI follows algorithms and strategies, learning from experience.
Consider a robot playing chess with a human. We observe it making strategic moves, but does that mean it is 'intelligent' in the human sense? Well, the answer is no. The robot is merely following algorithms and strategies it has been programmed with, and it learns from past games through machine learning, which allows it to improve its performance over time.
Algorithm
Sequences of step-by-step instructions given to a computer that equip it to solve specific problems.
The Turing Test
The question of whether a robot's actions during a chess game equate to intelligence, or if it is just executing a programming process, is not a new one.
Human A Computer ? 
The Turing Test evaluates if a machine's responses are indistinguishable from a human's.
Back in 1950, Alan Turing, a well-known mathematician and computer scientist, asked the question: "How can we determine if a machine is intelligent or not?" To answer this question, he created the famous Turing Test.
The Turing Test
In the Turing Test, a human questioner would interact with either a human respondent or a computer. The questioner would then have to evaluate whether it was a computer or a human being that was responding.
The purpose of the test was not to see if the answer was correct. For example, when asking a question like "what is the sum of two plus two", Turing did not seek to assess if the answer would be four, but more specifically, to evaluate whether the respondent was a machine or a human.
Turing's Goal
When Turing created this test, he was trying to reach the point where it would no longer be possible to distinguish between responses from machines and humans, where machines would be able to respond with the same functionalities and nuances that human beings have.
AI in Everyday Life
AI has advanced significantly over the years and is increasingly present in our daily lives. Take for instance your interaction with social media apps, like Instagram. The app uses machine learning, a subset of AI, to determine the content to show you next based on your recent activity.
AI is present in many everyday devices, from smartphones to smart speakers and home robots.
A similar process is at work when you finish looking at a program on certain streaming apps. The app's AI analyzes your viewing habits to recommend what you might want to watch next.
AI vs. Fiction
Even though AI is all around us, it can be portrayed inaccurately, a common occurrence in Hollywood films. Some films depict AI as having feelings or being superior to humans. Usually, these narratives serve to provoke thought rather than accurately represent how humans interact with AI.
These representations are artistic interpretations and do not actually reflect AI's capabilities. So, while AI can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence, it is important to remember that it operates very differently from human intelligence.
AI does not have consciousness, emotions, or the ability to understand context in the same way humans do. It is a tool created and controlled by humans, and its capabilities are limited to what it has been programmed to do.
That is why it is so important to understand what AI is - it allows you to discern fact from fiction.

Chapter 1.02: Knowledge vs Intelligence
Understanding the key differences between knowledge and intelligence in AI
Introduction Chinese Room Key Differences Practical Examples AI Applications 
Introduction to Knowledge vs Intelligence
Continuing with the question, "Can a machine ever truly be considered intelligent?" In 1980, John Searle, an American philosopher, created a test to answer this question, known as the Chinese Room Argument.
Artificial intelligence has evolved dramatically from its early conceptual beginnings.
Correct, artificial intelligence is not a new concept, as it has been developed and tested throughout history. The Chinese Room Argument provides an insightful framework for distinguishing between knowledge and intelligence in AI systems.
The Chinese Room Argument
Let's dive into Searle's famous thought experiment, the "Chinese Room Argument."
汉字 
The Chinese Room Argument: A person manipulates Chinese symbols using rules without understanding Chinese.
Imagine you know how to speak Mandarin, but your friend does not. Your friend enters a room filled with symbols and a rulebook. The rulebook states: "When you see this symbol, answer with that symbol".
You are outside the room, sending your friend a message in Mandarin. Your friend, inside the room, does not understand Mandarin, but follows the rulebook. They look at the symbols, figure out the pattern and respond accordingly.
When you receive their response, you may think your friend understands Mandarin, but in reality, they are just following a set of rules without understanding the language.
Key Differences: Knowledge vs Intelligence
Knowledge vs Intelligence
This test is intended to show that knowledge and intelligence are two very different things. When it comes to AI, a machine may not know Mandarin, but it knows how to recognize the pattern and answer with a message.
Knowledge Intelligence 
Knowledge is information stored and accessed, while intelligence is the ability to apply and adapt that knowledge.
Perhaps this analogy with Mandarin is not part of your daily routine, but interacting with AI virtual assistants like Siri might be. Who has not asked Siri to tell a joke or share a story?
At the end of the day, these systems convert our language into something they can recognize. They are constantly searching for matches in their databases, but they don't truly comprehend our language. Let's look at another example of this.
Practical Examples of Knowledge vs Intelligence
Imagine you are not feeling well, and you arrive at a doctor's office for a visit. You will go through a series of questions asked by nurses, "How long have you been feeling like this?" "What is your pain like, on a scale from 0 to 10?"
? ? ?  
The medical diagnostic process involves repetitive data collection that AI could streamline.
They would check your vital signs, and then when you finally see the doctor, you'd repeat much of the same information. It is a repetitive process that takes up time and resources.
AI in Medical Diagnostics
Now, imagine a second situation: Upon arriving at the doctor's office, an AI system asks all these questions. It swiftly analyses your responses, takes your vital signs, and any other relevant information. By the time you meet with the doctor, the system has already generated a preliminary diagnosis based on the patterns it identified.
It streamlines the process, allowing the doctor to address your needs more efficiently. This system operates intelligently by identifying patterns within the collected data thereby accelerating the diagnosis and treatment process.
Applications in Modern AI
As we have seen, knowledge and intelligence, while interconnected, are fundamentally different. Knowledge is about understanding the world around us, while intelligence is about applying that knowledge in new and innovative ways.
Knowledge and intelligence work together in AI systems to create practical applications.
But what fuels this programming? What allows AI to recognize patterns, make predictions, and learn from past experiences? The answer is data.
The Fuel for AI: Data
Data is the raw material that powers AI systems. It provides the foundation for both knowledge (stored information) and intelligence (pattern recognition and application). As we'll explore in the next chapter, understanding the role of data is crucial to comprehending how modern AI systems function.

Chapter 1.03: Data Everywhere
Understanding how data fuels AI systems and impacts our daily lives
Introduction Data Importance Data Production Data Refinement Applications 
Introduction to Data
Have you ever wondered why data collecting is so important in today's world and what it can be used for?
Data is constantly generated through our everyday digital interactions.
Data: The Fuel for AI
Data is the raw material AI systems use to analyze and make predictions, and you probably produce way more data than you realize, even just through your mobile phone.
Back in the 1990s, the rise of the internet marked a significant leap in access to data and the use of AI. This era set the stage for the data-driven world we live in today.
The Importance of Data in AI
Fast forward to the present, we have no shortage of data fuelling analyses and personal pattern recognition processes.
1990 1995 2000 2010 
The exponential growth of data over the decades has fueled AI advancement.
Just imagine how much data is being created while you watch this video. Maybe you are sending a text message to a friend. At the same time, someone next to you might be on a call. Somebody else has just posted a photo on their social media page while another has started a new video series that piqued their interest on a streaming app.
The Data Explosion
Data is constantly being generated with each passing second. Every interaction with digital technology—from scrolling through social media to shopping online or even just having your phone in your pocket—creates new data points that can be analyzed by AI systems.
How We Produce Data
Correct... all these actions create new data. Let's explore some common ways we generate data in our daily lives:
People produce data through gaming, phone calls, watching TV, typing, and even at gas pumps.
A man plays a video game, a woman is on a cell phone, a TV displays a bird, hands type on a keyboard next to a gas pump. All of these everyday activities generate valuable data that AI systems can learn from.
Refining Raw Data
Yet this raw data requires careful refinement. Data needs to be refined because the quality of the dataset used to train algorithms have a direct influence on the accuracy of the AI model.
Raw data must be refined before it can be effectively used by AI models.
Quality Over Quantity
That means that diverse and representative high-quality data is essential to developing advanced AI models. The refinement process removes errors, inconsistencies, and biases that could affect the AI's performance.
Applications of Data in AI Systems
Consider a music streaming service. It uses the data from your listening habits, such as the songs you skip, the ones you play on repeat, and the playlists you create, to recommend new music that you might like.
Your Daily Mix Your Top Songs 2024 Your Time Capsule A New Song For You 
Music streaming services use your listening data to make personalized recommendations.
This is a practical example of how data is used to enhance our everyday experiences and how datasets train the AI models to recommend the next song for you. And that is what we use machine learning for, to analyse and learn from the data. But it does not stop there.
From Data to Value
Once we have this information, we can use it to train AI models, improve products and services, make predictions, and even uncover new insights that were previously hidden. It's about recognizing patterns and making connections that might not be immediately obvious.
So, the next time you use your mobile phone, remember that every action you take, every piece of data you generate, contributes to this vast, interconnected web of information. And it is through understanding this data that we can truly unlock the potential of AI.

Chapter 1.04: Finding Patterns in Data
How AI identifies and utilizes patterns in data
Introduction Pattern Recognition AI and Patterns Social Media Business Applications 
Introduction to Patterns in Data
Data is constantly being created and refined to train AI models. But what exactly are these models looking for in the data?
AI systems look for patterns within vast amounts of seemingly random data.
Patterns
Patterns are identifiable repetitive behaviors or structures that occur within data. AI models are particularly good at recognizing these patterns, mainly because they have access to a large volume of data.
Pattern Recognition in Action
Let's consider LinkedIn as an example. Have you ever noticed how LinkedIn suggests people you might know or jobs that you might be interested in?
in David Senior Art Director at Microsoft, Barcelona Susanne Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft, Paris 
LinkedIn uses pattern recognition to suggest connections based on your profile and behavior.
It is not just based on your connections or job search history, but also on the behaviors of people all around the world who have similar connections or job interests.
Time-Based Patterns
What is really interesting is platforms like LinkedIn may look for patterns not only within your professional network and job preferences, but also in relation to the specific times you are active on the platform. For example, many people tend to browse apps during their lunch breaks or after work hours, so apps may suggest new connections or posts at those times too.
How AI Models Identify Patterns
This pattern identification does not just occur on platforms like LinkedIn, but with many companies across many apps and platforms.
#  #  #  
AI systems identify patterns across user behaviors to predict preferences and interests.
Imagine the benefits of understanding what users really want or even creating new consumption trends based on the market. This understanding allows companies to customise their services for each user, thereby enhancing the user experience and boosting satisfaction.
Pattern Recognition in Social Media
It is about using data to meet the needs of the user in the most effective way possible. Every click, every like, every search - these are all pieces of data. AI models process this vast amount of data to notice patterns.
Every click on a website provides data that AI can use to identify patterns and preferences.
These patterns help the AI model tailor your experience, making it more relevant and engaging. It is like having a personal assistant who knows exactly what you need, even before you do!
Business Applications of Pattern Recognition
Think about the World Cup. What are potentially the best-selling products before the tournament?
10 
Recognizing trends like team shirt sales during the World Cup helps businesses make strategic decisions.
You might be thinking team shirts. Recognizing this trend of team shirt consumption can provide a unique competitive edge for companies. It could even help in the new development of products or features.
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
But how does an AI model learn to recognize these patterns? Well, it does so through machine learning. In the next chapter, we'll explore how machine learning enables AI systems to identify and utilize patterns to make predictions and decisions.

Chapter 1.05: Machine Learning
Understanding the differences between AI and machine learning, and how machines learn from data
Introduction AI vs ML Learning Types Mathematical Foundations Learning Analogy 
Understanding Machine Learning
You might have heard the terms 'machine learning' and 'AI' used interchangeably, and you may be wondering, 'What is the difference?' Well, there is a difference, and it is important to understand how they are different.
AI ML What's the difference? Artificial intelligence Deep learning Machine learning 
Machine Learning is a subset of AI, but the two terms are often used interchangeably.
AI vs Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by software and machines. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI. This means that while all machine learning is AI, not all AI involves machine learning.
Distinguishing Between AI and Machine Learning
Machine learning is a type of AI where a machine learns from the data it has been given and can identify patterns in that data. It is also the process by which machines learn from data and improve their performance over time.
Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning All machine learning is AI, but not all AI involves machine learning. ML 
The relationship between AI and Machine Learning: ML is a specific approach within the broader field of AI.
Machine learning uses different types of techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The term 'Machine Learning' was introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959, who created a program that played draughts against itself.
Historical Origin
Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in computer gaming and AI, created a program that played draughts. The machine analyzed the game through repetitive plays, identifying strategies to win and avoid losses. Through playing the game and learning what to do to win, it began to detect recurring patterns and would increasingly follow a pattern.
Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning can be divided into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each approach has distinct characteristics and applications.
Supervised learning X Label: Cat Y Label: Dog Unsupervised learning Reinforcement learning + - 
The three primary types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
•	Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where inputs are paired with correct outputs.
•	Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and must find structure without guidance.
•	Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
To achieve effective machine learning, Samuel had to use mathematics. Concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics play a crucial role in understanding how machine learning algorithms learn from data and make predictions.
Linear Algebra: A = [a₁₁ a₁₂] [a₂₁ a₂₂] Calculus: f'(x) = lim Δx→0 [f(x+Δx) - f(x)]/Δx Probability: P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B) Statistics: σ² = Σ(xᵢ - μ)²/n 
Mathematical concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics form the foundation of machine learning algorithms.
These mathematical concepts help in optimizing the performance of the model, understanding the relationships within the data, and making accurate predictions. They are the building blocks that enable machines to learn from experience and improve over time.
The Bicycle Analogy: Learning from Experience
Need further clarity? Let's consider the analogy of learning to ride a bicycle to understand how machine learning works.
Learning Phase Application Phase 
The process of learning to ride a bicycle mirrors how machine learning models progress from initial training to independent performance.
Learning Through Experience
When you first learn to ride a bicycle, you might start with training wheels. These training wheels are like the initial data set that we feed into the machine learning model. They provide basic guidance and stability. As you practice more, you learn to balance, pedal, and steer. This mirrors how a machine learning model begins to recognize patterns during training.
Eventually, the training wheels come off, and you adapt to different situations – riding on hills or through crowds. Similarly, a machine learning model applies what it has learned to new data and tasks, improving its performance based on experience.
This draughts game and bicycle learning analogy highlight the fundamental concepts of machine learning: learning from experience, replicating results, and improving performance. As we continue to explore AI and its capabilities, remember that all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.

Chapter 1.06: Types of Machine Learning
Exploring supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches
Introduction Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning Deep Learning 
Learning Methods in Machine Learning
Ever wondered how you learned to ride a bike or play an instrument? It's all about learning from experience, correct? Well, machines can do that, too! They can learn in three main ways: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
Supervised Unsupervised Reinforcement AI 
Learning from experience is fundamental to human learning and machine learning.
Three Main Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms can be classified into three main types:
•	Supervised Learning: Algorithm is trained on data that's labeled with the correct answers
•	Unsupervised Learning: Algorithm is trained on unlabeled or raw data
•	Reinforcement Learning: Algorithm is trained by interacting with its environment to achieve a goal
Let's break down each type with a simple analogy: learning to play football.
Supervised Learning: Learning with a Trainer
In the first scenario of our football analogy, you have a trainer who supervises you and teaches you all the rules.
Rules 0:0 
In supervised learning, like football training, the algorithm learns from labeled examples provided by a "trainer."
They carefully explain that when the ball enters the goal, you earn a point, and when the ball goes out of play over the sideline, it must be thrown in by hand. They explain all the rules, how many players there are, how long the game lasts, and so on. In this case, you have a person supervising you and teaching you all the rules of the game.
How Supervised Learning Works
In supervised learning, the algorithm is given a set of input data along with the correct output (labels). It learns by finding patterns that map the input to the output. This is similar to how a football coach might show a player exactly what to do, and the player learns by following these instructions.
Examples of supervised learning applications include:
•	Email spam detection (spam or not spam)
•	Image recognition (identifying what's in an image)
•	Weather forecasting (predicting future weather based on historical data)
Unsupervised Learning: Figuring It Out on Your Own
In the second scenario of our football analogy, you are on your own. You start attending games every Thursday and Sunday without prior instruction.
? Cheering Groaning 
In unsupervised learning, like watching football games without instruction, the algorithm identifies patterns without being told what to look for.
Initially, you are puzzled. Why are players using their hands from the sidelines in a game primarily played with feet? Why is the crowd cheering when the ball hits the net, and why do they groan when it does not? But as you keep watching, you start recognizing patterns and understanding the game's dynamics.
Clustering and Association
Unsupervised learning algorithms find structure in data without explicit guidance. There are two main types:
•	Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (like recognizing that certain players on a team work together in specific formations)
•	Association: Discovering rules that describe relationships in the data (like understanding that when the ball goes into the net, the crowd cheers)
Applications include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.
Reinforcement Learning: Learning from Rewards
Now, let's consider a third scenario, which is like reinforcement learning. Imagine you are practicing penalty kicks.
Positive Reward Negative Reward 
In reinforcement learning, like practicing penalty kicks, the algorithm learns from positive and negative feedback.
Each time you score a goal, you feel a sense of achievement, which is a positive reward. Each time you miss, you feel disappointment, which is a negative reward. Over time, by trying different ways of kicking the ball and learning from the rewards, you improve your ability to score penalty kicks.
Reward-Based Learning
Reinforcement learning is based on an agent (the learner) that interacts with its environment, taking actions to maximize cumulative rewards. The key components are:
•	Agent: The decision-maker (like the football player)
•	Environment: The world in which the agent operates (the football field)
•	Actions: What the agent can do (different kick techniques)
•	Rewards: Feedback from the environment (scoring or missing)
Applications include game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and resource management.
Deep Learning: Taking Machine Learning Further
Remember, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI involves machine learning. Machine learning can be broken down into these types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. But we can go even deeper.
Input Layer Hidden Layer Output Layer 
Deep learning uses advanced neural networks with multiple layers to process complex information.
There are advanced forms of machine learning that mimic the human brain's own method of learning. They take the concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning and apply them on a much larger scale. This is called deep learning.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Just as neurons in the brain are connected to form a vast network, deep learning uses artificial neural networks with several layers - hence the term 'deep'.
These networks can learn and make decisions on their own. They excel at tasks such as:
•	Image and speech recognition
•	Natural language processing
•	Recommendation systems
•	Medical diagnoses
In conclusion, machine learning approaches vary based on the task at hand and the available data. Understanding these different types helps us appreciate how AI systems learn and adapt to solve complex problems. As we move forward, we'll explore deep learning in more detail and see how these neural networks are revolutionizing artificial intelligence.

GENERATION, DISTRIBUTION, TRANSMISSION 
The electrical energy is today an essential factor for the industrial and social development of any country. It is commonly obtained from non-re-generative sources such as fossil fuels, and as consumption per capita and population grow, its limited production needs to be efficiently managed to satisfy the increasing world demand. Modern electric power systems have grown and expanded geographical…

POWER PLANTS 
The generation of electrical energy consists of transforming a type of energy (chemical, kinetic, thermal, light, nuclear, solar, among others), into electrical energy. For industrial generation, facilities called power plants are used, which carry out some of the aforementioned transformations. These constitute the first step of the power supply system. As energy consumption will continue to in…

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
In the didactic laboratory for the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions, the challenge-based learning (CBL) approach focuses on providing students with practical, real-world challenges that allow them to apply theoretical knowledge in specific situations. Rather than simply presenting information passively, this approach engages students in solving problems and creating innovative solutions. Students are faced with challenges that simulate real-life and industry problems, such as process optimization, anomaly detection or efficiency improvement. Using the hardware and software available in the lab, as well as artificial intelligence tools, students work in teams to develop practical solutions that address these challenges.

Chapter 1.01: What is Artificial Intelligence?
Understanding the fundamentals of AI
Introduction Defining AI AI Intelligence Turing Test Everyday AI 
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, or AI, has become a buzzword you might have heard recently through social media, in conversations, or even on TV. However, it is not new. In fact, you have been using AI for years and might not even realize it.
AI has evolved from a new concept to a technology integrated into our daily lives.
At times, AI is portrayed as a force capable of changing the way we live, work, and interact. But beyond the hype, AI is a tool that has been evolving over decades, shaped by the contributions of countless individuals across various fields.
And AI is not just for those who work with technology—it is for all of us. Understanding the fundamentals of artificial intelligence helps demystify this increasingly important technology and empowers us to engage with it more effectively.
Defining Artificial Intelligence
What is AI?
AI is the ability of a computer system to learn from past data and errors, enabling it to make increasingly accurate predictions for future behavior.
This encompasses a broad range of activities, such as problem-solving, speech recognition, learning, and decision-making. AI systems can process and analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions that would be difficult or impossible for humans to discern.
AI encompasses problem-solving, speech recognition, and innovative thinking.
What Makes AI "Intelligent"?
So, what makes AI 'intelligent'? At its core, AI is the intelligence demonstrated by software or machines in performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
These tasks can include recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions. For example, when you interact with Siri on your mobile phone, it is not exhibiting intelligence in the same way a human would.
Rather, humans have programmed it to respond to certain prompts and execute functions, such as providing the latest weather update in your area or letting you know your local news.
A chess-playing AI follows algorithms and strategies, learning from experience.
Consider a robot playing chess with a human. We observe it making strategic moves, but does that mean it is 'intelligent' in the human sense? Well, the answer is no. The robot is merely following algorithms and strategies it has been programmed with, and it learns from past games through machine learning, which allows it to improve its performance over time.
Algorithm
Sequences of step-by-step instructions given to a computer that equip it to solve specific problems.
The Turing Test
The question of whether a robot's actions during a chess game equate to intelligence, or if it is just executing a programming process, is not a new one.
Human A Computer ? 
The Turing Test evaluates if a machine's responses are indistinguishable from a human's.
Back in 1950, Alan Turing, a well-known mathematician and computer scientist, asked the question: "How can we determine if a machine is intelligent or not?" To answer this question, he created the famous Turing Test.
The Turing Test
In the Turing Test, a human questioner would interact with either a human respondent or a computer. The questioner would then have to evaluate whether it was a computer or a human being that was responding.
The purpose of the test was not to see if the answer was correct. For example, when asking a question like "what is the sum of two plus two", Turing did not seek to assess if the answer would be four, but more specifically, to evaluate whether the respondent was a machine or a human.
Turing's Goal
When Turing created this test, he was trying to reach the point where it would no longer be possible to distinguish between responses from machines and humans, where machines would be able to respond with the same functionalities and nuances that human beings have.
AI in Everyday Life
AI has advanced significantly over the years and is increasingly present in our daily lives. Take for instance your interaction with social media apps, like Instagram. The app uses machine learning, a subset of AI, to determine the content to show you next based on your recent activity.
AI is present in many everyday devices, from smartphones to smart speakers and home robots.
A similar process is at work when you finish looking at a program on certain streaming apps. The app's AI analyzes your viewing habits to recommend what you might want to watch next.
AI vs. Fiction
Even though AI is all around us, it can be portrayed inaccurately, a common occurrence in Hollywood films. Some films depict AI as having feelings or being superior to humans. Usually, these narratives serve to provoke thought rather than accurately represent how humans interact with AI.
These representations are artistic interpretations and do not actually reflect AI's capabilities. So, while AI can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence, it is important to remember that it operates very differently from human intelligence.
AI does not have consciousness, emotions, or the ability to understand context in the same way humans do. It is a tool created and controlled by humans, and its capabilities are limited to what it has been programmed to do.
That is why it is so important to understand what AI is - it allows you to discern fact from fiction.

Chapter 1.02: Knowledge vs Intelligence
Understanding the key differences between knowledge and intelligence in AI
Introduction Chinese Room Key Differences Practical Examples AI Applications 
Introduction to Knowledge vs Intelligence
Continuing with the question, "Can a machine ever truly be considered intelligent?" In 1980, John Searle, an American philosopher, created a test to answer this question, known as the Chinese Room Argument.
Artificial intelligence has evolved dramatically from its early conceptual beginnings.
Correct, artificial intelligence is not a new concept, as it has been developed and tested throughout history. The Chinese Room Argument provides an insightful framework for distinguishing between knowledge and intelligence in AI systems.
The Chinese Room Argument
Let's dive into Searle's famous thought experiment, the "Chinese Room Argument."
汉字 
The Chinese Room Argument: A person manipulates Chinese symbols using rules without understanding Chinese.
Imagine you know how to speak Mandarin, but your friend does not. Your friend enters a room filled with symbols and a rulebook. The rulebook states: "When you see this symbol, answer with that symbol".
You are outside the room, sending your friend a message in Mandarin. Your friend, inside the room, does not understand Mandarin, but follows the rulebook. They look at the symbols, figure out the pattern and respond accordingly.
When you receive their response, you may think your friend understands Mandarin, but in reality, they are just following a set of rules without understanding the language.
Key Differences: Knowledge vs Intelligence
Knowledge vs Intelligence
This test is intended to show that knowledge and intelligence are two very different things. When it comes to AI, a machine may not know Mandarin, but it knows how to recognize the pattern and answer with a message.
Knowledge Intelligence 
Knowledge is information stored and accessed, while intelligence is the ability to apply and adapt that knowledge.
Perhaps this analogy with Mandarin is not part of your daily routine, but interacting with AI virtual assistants like Siri might be. Who has not asked Siri to tell a joke or share a story?
At the end of the day, these systems convert our language into something they can recognize. They are constantly searching for matches in their databases, but they don't truly comprehend our language. Let's look at another example of this.
Practical Examples of Knowledge vs Intelligence
Imagine you are not feeling well, and you arrive at a doctor's office for a visit. You will go through a series of questions asked by nurses, "How long have you been feeling like this?" "What is your pain like, on a scale from 0 to 10?"
? ? ?  
The medical diagnostic process involves repetitive data collection that AI could streamline.
They would check your vital signs, and then when you finally see the doctor, you'd repeat much of the same information. It is a repetitive process that takes up time and resources.
AI in Medical Diagnostics
Now, imagine a second situation: Upon arriving at the doctor's office, an AI system asks all these questions. It swiftly analyses your responses, takes your vital signs, and any other relevant information. By the time you meet with the doctor, the system has already generated a preliminary diagnosis based on the patterns it identified.
It streamlines the process, allowing the doctor to address your needs more efficiently. This system operates intelligently by identifying patterns within the collected data thereby accelerating the diagnosis and treatment process.
Applications in Modern AI
As we have seen, knowledge and intelligence, while interconnected, are fundamentally different. Knowledge is about understanding the world around us, while intelligence is about applying that knowledge in new and innovative ways.
Knowledge and intelligence work together in AI systems to create practical applications.
But what fuels this programming? What allows AI to recognize patterns, make predictions, and learn from past experiences? The answer is data.
The Fuel for AI: Data
Data is the raw material that powers AI systems. It provides the foundation for both knowledge (stored information) and intelligence (pattern recognition and application). As we'll explore in the next chapter, understanding the role of data is crucial to comprehending how modern AI systems function.

Understanding how data fuels AI systems and impacts our daily lives
Introduction Data Importance Data Production Data Refinement Applications 
Introduction to Data
Have you ever wondered why data collecting is so important in today's world and what it can be used for?
Data is constantly generated through our everyday digital interactions.
Data: The Fuel for AI
Data is the raw material AI systems use to analyze and make predictions, and you probably produce way more data than you realize, even just through your mobile phone.
Back in the 1990s, the rise of the internet marked a significant leap in access to data and the use of AI. This era set the stage for the data-driven world we live in today.
The Importance of Data in AI
Fast forward to the present, we have no shortage of data fuelling analyses and personal pattern recognition processes.
1990 1995 2000 2010 
The exponential growth of data over the decades has fueled AI advancement.
Just imagine how much data is being created while you watch this video. Maybe you are sending a text message to a friend. At the same time, someone next to you might be on a call. Somebody else has just posted a photo on their social media page while another has started a new video series that piqued their interest on a streaming app.
The Data Explosion
Data is constantly being generated with each passing second. Every interaction with digital technology—from scrolling through social media to shopping online or even just having your phone in your pocket—creates new data points that can be analyzed by AI systems.
How We Produce Data
Correct... all these actions create new data. Let's explore some common ways we generate data in our daily lives:
People produce data through gaming, phone calls, watching TV, typing, and even at gas pumps.
A man plays a video game, a woman is on a cell phone, a TV displays a bird, hands type on a keyboard next to a gas pump. All of these everyday activities generate valuable data that AI systems can learn from.
Refining Raw Data
Yet this raw data requires careful refinement. Data needs to be refined because the quality of the dataset used to train algorithms have a direct influence on the accuracy of the AI model.
Raw data must be refined before it can be effectively used by AI models.
Quality Over Quantity
That means that diverse and representative high-quality data is essential to developing advanced AI models. The refinement process removes errors, inconsistencies, and biases that could affect the AI's performance.
Applications of Data in AI Systems
Consider a music streaming service. It uses the data from your listening habits, such as the songs you skip, the ones you play on repeat, and the playlists you create, to recommend new music that you might like.
Your Daily Mix Your Top Songs 2024 Your Time Capsule A New Song For You 
Music streaming services use your listening data to make personalized recommendations.
This is a practical example of how data is used to enhance our everyday experiences and how datasets train the AI models to recommend the next song for you. And that is what we use machine learning for, to analyse and learn from the data. But it does not stop there.
From Data to Value
Once we have this information, we can use it to train AI models, improve products and services, make predictions, and even uncover new insights that were previously hidden. It's about recognizing patterns and making connections that might not be immediately obvious.
So, the next time you use your mobile phone, remember that every action you take, every piece of data you generate, contributes to this vast, interconnected web of information. And it is through understanding this data that we can truly unlock the potential of AI.

Chapter 1.04: Finding Patterns in Data
How AI identifies and utilizes patterns in data
Introduction Pattern Recognition AI and Patterns Social Media Business Applications 
Introduction to Patterns in Data
Data is constantly being created and refined to train AI models. But what exactly are these models looking for in the data?
AI systems look for patterns within vast amounts of seemingly random data.
Patterns
Patterns are identifiable repetitive behaviors or structures that occur within data. AI models are particularly good at recognizing these patterns, mainly because they have access to a large volume of data.
Pattern Recognition in Action
Let's consider LinkedIn as an example. Have you ever noticed how LinkedIn suggests people you might know or jobs that you might be interested in?
in David Senior Art Director at Microsoft, Barcelona Susanne Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft, Paris 
LinkedIn uses pattern recognition to suggest connections based on your profile and behavior.
It is not just based on your connections or job search history, but also on the behaviors of people all around the world who have similar connections or job interests.
Time-Based Patterns
What is really interesting is platforms like LinkedIn may look for patterns not only within your professional network and job preferences, but also in relation to the specific times you are active on the platform. For example, many people tend to browse apps during their lunch breaks or after work hours, so apps may suggest new connections or posts at those times too.
How AI Models Identify Patterns
This pattern identification does not just occur on platforms like LinkedIn, but with many companies across many apps and platforms.
#  #  #  
AI systems identify patterns across user behaviors to predict preferences and interests.
Imagine the benefits of understanding what users really want or even creating new consumption trends based on the market. This understanding allows companies to customise their services for each user, thereby enhancing the user experience and boosting satisfaction.
Pattern Recognition in Social Media
It is about using data to meet the needs of the user in the most effective way possible. Every click, every like, every search - these are all pieces of data. AI models process this vast amount of data to notice patterns.
Every click on a website provides data that AI can use to identify patterns and preferences.
These patterns help the AI model tailor your experience, making it more relevant and engaging. It is like having a personal assistant who knows exactly what you need, even before you do!
Business Applications of Pattern Recognition
Think about the World Cup. What are potentially the best-selling products before the tournament?
10 
Recognizing trends like team shirt sales during the World Cup helps businesses make strategic decisions.
You might be thinking team shirts. Recognizing this trend of team shirt consumption can provide a unique competitive edge for companies. It could even help in the new development of products or features.
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
But how does an AI model learn to recognize these patterns? Well, it does so through machine learning. In the next chapter, we'll explore how machine learning enables AI systems to identify and utilize patterns to make predictions and decisions.

Understanding the differences between AI and machine learning, and how machines learn from data
Introduction AI vs ML Learning Types Mathematical Foundations Learning Analogy 
Understanding Machine Learning
You might have heard the terms 'machine learning' and 'AI' used interchangeably, and you may be wondering, 'What is the difference?' Well, there is a difference, and it is important to understand how they are different.
AI ML What's the difference? Artificial intelligence Deep learning Machine learning 
Machine Learning is a subset of AI, but the two terms are often used interchangeably.
AI vs Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by software and machines. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI. This means that while all machine learning is AI, not all AI involves machine learning.
Distinguishing Between AI and Machine Learning
Machine learning is a type of AI where a machine learns from the data it has been given and can identify patterns in that data. It is also the process by which machines learn from data and improve their performance over time.
Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning All machine learning is AI, but not all AI involves machine learning. ML 
The relationship between AI and Machine Learning: ML is a specific approach within the broader field of AI.
Machine learning uses different types of techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The term 'Machine Learning' was introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959, who created a program that played draughts against itself.
Historical Origin
Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in computer gaming and AI, created a program that played draughts. The machine analyzed the game through repetitive plays, identifying strategies to win and avoid losses. Through playing the game and learning what to do to win, it began to detect recurring patterns and would increasingly follow a pattern.
Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning can be divided into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each approach has distinct characteristics and applications.
Supervised learning X Label: Cat Y Label: Dog Unsupervised learning Reinforcement learning + - 
The three primary types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
•	Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where inputs are paired with correct outputs.
•	Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and must find structure without guidance.
•	Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
To achieve effective machine learning, Samuel had to use mathematics. Concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics play a crucial role in understanding how machine learning algorithms learn from data and make predictions.
Linear Algebra: A = [a₁₁ a₁₂] [a₂₁ a₂₂] Calculus: f'(x) = lim Δx→0 [f(x+Δx) - f(x)]/Δx Probability: P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B) Statistics: σ² = Σ(xᵢ - μ)²/n 
Mathematical concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics form the foundation of machine learning algorithms.
These mathematical concepts help in optimizing the performance of the model, understanding the relationships within the data, and making accurate predictions. They are the building blocks that enable machines to learn from experience and improve over time.
The Bicycle Analogy: Learning from Experience
Need further clarity? Let's consider the analogy of learning to ride a bicycle to understand how machine learning works.
Learning Phase Application Phase 
The process of learning to ride a bicycle mirrors how machine learning models progress from initial training to independent performance.
Learning Through Experience
When you first learn to ride a bicycle, you might start with training wheels. These training wheels are like the initial data set that we feed into the machine learning model. They provide basic guidance and stability. As you practice more, you learn to balance, pedal, and steer. This mirrors how a machine learning model begins to recognize patterns during training.
Eventually, the training wheels come off, and you adapt to different situations – riding on hills or through crowds. Similarly, a machine learning model applies what it has learned to new data and tasks, improving its performance based on experience.
This draughts game and bicycle learning analogy highlight the fundamental concepts of machine learning: learning from experience, replicating results, and improving performance. As we continue to explore AI and its capabilities, remember that all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.

Chapter 1.06: Types of Machine Learning
Exploring supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches
Introduction Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning Deep Learning 
Learning Methods in Machine Learning
Ever wondered how you learned to ride a bike or play an instrument? It's all about learning from experience, correct? Well, machines can do that, too! They can learn in three main ways: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
Supervised Unsupervised Reinforcement AI 
Learning from experience is fundamental to human learning and machine learning.
Three Main Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms can be classified into three main types:
•	Supervised Learning: Algorithm is trained on data that's labeled with the correct answers
•	Unsupervised Learning: Algorithm is trained on unlabeled or raw data
•	Reinforcement Learning: Algorithm is trained by interacting with its environment to achieve a goal
Let's break down each type with a simple analogy: learning to play football.
Supervised Learning: Learning with a Trainer
In the first scenario of our football analogy, you have a trainer who supervises you and teaches you all the rules.
Rules 0:0 
In supervised learning, like football training, the algorithm learns from labeled examples provided by a "trainer."
They carefully explain that when the ball enters the goal, you earn a point, and when the ball goes out of play over the sideline, it must be thrown in by hand. They explain all the rules, how many players there are, how long the game lasts, and so on. In this case, you have a person supervising you and teaching you all the rules of the game.
How Supervised Learning Works
In supervised learning, the algorithm is given a set of input data along with the correct output (labels). It learns by finding patterns that map the input to the output. This is similar to how a football coach might show a player exactly what to do, and the player learns by following these instructions.
Examples of supervised learning applications include:
•	Email spam detection (spam or not spam)
•	Image recognition (identifying what's in an image)
•	Weather forecasting (predicting future weather based on historical data)
Unsupervised Learning: Figuring It Out on Your Own
In the second scenario of our football analogy, you are on your own. You start attending games every Thursday and Sunday without prior instruction.
? Cheering Groaning 
In unsupervised learning, like watching football games without instruction, the algorithm identifies patterns without being told what to look for.
Initially, you are puzzled. Why are players using their hands from the sidelines in a game primarily played with feet? Why is the crowd cheering when the ball hits the net, and why do they groan when it does not? But as you keep watching, you start recognizing patterns and understanding the game's dynamics.
Clustering and Association
Unsupervised learning algorithms find structure in data without explicit guidance. There are two main types:
•	Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (like recognizing that certain players on a team work together in specific formations)
•	Association: Discovering rules that describe relationships in the data (like understanding that when the ball goes into the net, the crowd cheers)
Applications include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.
Reinforcement Learning: Learning from Rewards
Now, let's consider a third scenario, which is like reinforcement learning. Imagine you are practicing penalty kicks.
Positive Reward Negative Reward 
In reinforcement learning, like practicing penalty kicks, the algorithm learns from positive and negative feedback.
Each time you score a goal, you feel a sense of achievement, which is a positive reward. Each time you miss, you feel disappointment, which is a negative reward. Over time, by trying different ways of kicking the ball and learning from the rewards, you improve your ability to score penalty kicks.
Reward-Based Learning
Reinforcement learning is based on an agent (the learner) that interacts with its environment, taking actions to maximize cumulative rewards. The key components are:
•	Agent: The decision-maker (like the football player)
•	Environment: The world in which the agent operates (the football field)
•	Actions: What the agent can do (different kick techniques)
•	Rewards: Feedback from the environment (scoring or missing)
Applications include game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and resource management.
Deep Learning: Taking Machine Learning Further
Remember, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI involves machine learning. Machine learning can be broken down into these types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. But we can go even deeper.
Input Layer Hidden Layer Output Layer 
Deep learning uses advanced neural networks with multiple layers to process complex information.
There are advanced forms of machine learning that mimic the human brain's own method of learning. They take the concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning and apply them on a much larger scale. This is called deep learning.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Just as neurons in the brain are connected to form a vast network, deep learning uses artificial neural networks with several layers - hence the term 'deep'.
These networks can learn and make decisions on their own. They excel at tasks such as:
•	Image and speech recognition
•	Natural language processing
•	Recommendation systems
•	Medical diagnoses
In conclusion, machine learning approaches vary based on the task at hand and the available data. Understanding these different types helps us appreciate how AI systems learn and adapt to solve complex problems. As we move forward, we'll explore deep learning in more detail and see how these neural networks are revolutionizing artificial intelligence.

GENERATION, DISTRIBUTION, TRANSMISSION 
The electrical energy is today an essential factor for the industrial and social development of any country. It is commonly obtained from non-re-generative sources such as fossil fuels, and as consumption per capita and population grow, its limited production needs to be efficiently managed to satisfy the increasing world demand. Modern electric power systems have grown and expanded geographical…

POWER PLANTS 
The generation of electrical energy consists of transforming a type of energy (chemical, kinetic, thermal, light, nuclear, solar, among others), into electrical energy. For industrial generation, facilities called power plants are used, which carry out some of the aforementioned transformations. These constitute the first step of the power supply system. As energy consumption will continue to in…

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
In the didactic laboratory for the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions, the challenge-based learning (CBL) approach focuses on providing students with practical, real-world challenges that allow them to apply theoretical knowledge in specific situations. Rather than simply presenting information passively, this approach engages students in solving problems and creating innovative solutions. Students are faced with challenges that simulate real-life and industry problems, such as process optimization, anomaly detection or efficiency improvement. Using the hardware and software available in the lab, as well as artificial intelligence tools, students work in teams to develop practical solutions that address these challenges.

Module 1: AI Foundations
Chapter 1.01: What is Artificial Intelligence?
Understanding the fundamentals of AI
Introduction Defining AI AI Intelligence Turing Test Everyday AI 
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, or AI, has become a buzzword you might have heard recently through social media, in conversations, or even on TV. However, it is not new. In fact, you have been using AI for years and might not even realize it.
AI has evolved from a new concept to a technology integrated into our daily lives.
At times, AI is portrayed as a force capable of changing the way we live, work, and interact. But beyond the hype, AI is a tool that has been evolving over decades, shaped by the contributions of countless individuals across various fields.
And AI is not just for those who work with technology—it is for all of us. Understanding the fundamentals of artificial intelligence helps demystify this increasingly important technology and empowers us to engage with it more effectively.
Defining Artificial Intelligence
What is AI?
AI is the ability of a computer system to learn from past data and errors, enabling it to make increasingly accurate predictions for future behavior.
This encompasses a broad range of activities, such as problem-solving, speech recognition, learning, and decision-making. AI systems can process and analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions that would be difficult or impossible for humans to discern.
AI encompasses problem-solving, speech recognition, and innovative thinking.
What Makes AI "Intelligent"?
So, what makes AI 'intelligent'? At its core, AI is the intelligence demonstrated by software or machines in performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
These tasks can include recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions. For example, when you interact with Siri on your mobile phone, it is not exhibiting intelligence in the same way a human would.
Rather, humans have programmed it to respond to certain prompts and execute functions, such as providing the latest weather update in your area or letting you know your local news.
A chess-playing AI follows algorithms and strategies, learning from experience.
Consider a robot playing chess with a human. We observe it making strategic moves, but does that mean it is 'intelligent' in the human sense? Well, the answer is no. The robot is merely following algorithms and strategies it has been programmed with, and it learns from past games through machine learning, which allows it to improve its performance over time.
Algorithm
Sequences of step-by-step instructions given to a computer that equip it to solve specific problems.
The Turing Test
The question of whether a robot's actions during a chess game equate to intelligence, or if it is just executing a programming process, is not a new one.
Human A Computer ? 
The Turing Test evaluates if a machine's responses are indistinguishable from a human's.
Back in 1950, Alan Turing, a well-known mathematician and computer scientist, asked the question: "How can we determine if a machine is intelligent or not?" To answer this question, he created the famous Turing Test.
The Turing Test
In the Turing Test, a human questioner would interact with either a human respondent or a computer. The questioner would then have to evaluate whether it was a computer or a human being that was responding.
The purpose of the test was not to see if the answer was correct. For example, when asking a question like "what is the sum of two plus two", Turing did not seek to assess if the answer would be four, but more specifically, to evaluate whether the respondent was a machine or a human.
Turing's Goal
When Turing created this test, he was trying to reach the point where it would no longer be possible to distinguish between responses from machines and humans, where machines would be able to respond with the same functionalities and nuances that human beings have.
AI in Everyday Life
AI has advanced significantly over the years and is increasingly present in our daily lives. Take for instance your interaction with social media apps, like Instagram. The app uses machine learning, a subset of AI, to determine the content to show you next based on your recent activity.
AI is present in many everyday devices, from smartphones to smart speakers and home robots.
A similar process is at work when you finish looking at a program on certain streaming apps. The app's AI analyzes your viewing habits to recommend what you might want to watch next.
AI vs. Fiction
Even though AI is all around us, it can be portrayed inaccurately, a common occurrence in Hollywood films. Some films depict AI as having feelings or being superior to humans. Usually, these narratives serve to provoke thought rather than accurately represent how humans interact with AI.
These representations are artistic interpretations and do not actually reflect AI's capabilities. So, while AI can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence, it is important to remember that it operates very differently from human intelligence.
AI does not have consciousness, emotions, or the ability to understand context in the same way humans do. It is a tool created and controlled by humans, and its capabilities are limited to what it has been programmed to do.
That is why it is so important to understand what AI is - it allows you to discern fact from fiction.

Chapter 1.02: Knowledge vs Intelligence
Understanding the key differences between knowledge and intelligence in AI
Introduction Chinese Room Key Differences Practical Examples AI Applications 
Introduction to Knowledge vs Intelligence
Continuing with the question, "Can a machine ever truly be considered intelligent?" In 1980, John Searle, an American philosopher, created a test to answer this question, known as the Chinese Room Argument.
Artificial intelligence has evolved dramatically from its early conceptual beginnings.
Correct, artificial intelligence is not a new concept, as it has been developed and tested throughout history. The Chinese Room Argument provides an insightful framework for distinguishing between knowledge and intelligence in AI systems.
The Chinese Room Argument
Let's dive into Searle's famous thought experiment, the "Chinese Room Argument."
汉字 
The Chinese Room Argument: A person manipulates Chinese symbols using rules without understanding Chinese.
Imagine you know how to speak Mandarin, but your friend does not. Your friend enters a room filled with symbols and a rulebook. The rulebook states: "When you see this symbol, answer with that symbol".
You are outside the room, sending your friend a message in Mandarin. Your friend, inside the room, does not understand Mandarin, but follows the rulebook. They look at the symbols, figure out the pattern and respond accordingly.
When you receive their response, you may think your friend understands Mandarin, but in reality, they are just following a set of rules without understanding the language.
Key Differences: Knowledge vs Intelligence
Knowledge vs Intelligence
This test is intended to show that knowledge and intelligence are two very different things. When it comes to AI, a machine may not know Mandarin, but it knows how to recognize the pattern and answer with a message.
Knowledge Intelligence 
Knowledge is information stored and accessed, while intelligence is the ability to apply and adapt that knowledge.
Perhaps this analogy with Mandarin is not part of your daily routine, but interacting with AI virtual assistants like Siri might be. Who has not asked Siri to tell a joke or share a story?
At the end of the day, these systems convert our language into something they can recognize. They are constantly searching for matches in their databases, but they don't truly comprehend our language. Let's look at another example of this.
Practical Examples of Knowledge vs Intelligence
Imagine you are not feeling well, and you arrive at a doctor's office for a visit. You will go through a series of questions asked by nurses, "How long have you been feeling like this?" "What is your pain like, on a scale from 0 to 10?"
? ? ?  
The medical diagnostic process involves repetitive data collection that AI could streamline.
They would check your vital signs, and then when you finally see the doctor, you'd repeat much of the same information. It is a repetitive process that takes up time and resources.
AI in Medical Diagnostics
Now, imagine a second situation: Upon arriving at the doctor's office, an AI system asks all these questions. It swiftly analyses your responses, takes your vital signs, and any other relevant information. By the time you meet with the doctor, the system has already generated a preliminary diagnosis based on the patterns it identified.
It streamlines the process, allowing the doctor to address your needs more efficiently. This system operates intelligently by identifying patterns within the collected data thereby accelerating the diagnosis and treatment process.
Applications in Modern AI
As we have seen, knowledge and intelligence, while interconnected, are fundamentally different. Knowledge is about understanding the world around us, while intelligence is about applying that knowledge in new and innovative ways.
Knowledge and intelligence work together in AI systems to create practical applications.
But what fuels this programming? What allows AI to recognize patterns, make predictions, and learn from past experiences? The answer is data.
The Fuel for AI: Data
Data is the raw material that powers AI systems. It provides the foundation for both knowledge (stored information) and intelligence (pattern recognition and application). As we'll explore in the next chapter, understanding the role of data is crucial to comprehending how modern AI systems function.

Chapter 1.03: Data Everywhere
Understanding how data fuels AI systems and impacts our daily lives
Introduction Data Importance Data Production Data Refinement Applications 
Introduction to Data
Have you ever wondered why data collecting is so important in today's world and what it can be used for?
Data is constantly generated through our everyday digital interactions.
Data: The Fuel for AI
Data is the raw material AI systems use to analyze and make predictions, and you probably produce way more data than you realize, even just through your mobile phone.
Back in the 1990s, the rise of the internet marked a significant leap in access to data and the use of AI. This era set the stage for the data-driven world we live in today.
The Importance of Data in AI
Fast forward to the present, we have no shortage of data fuelling analyses and personal pattern recognition processes.
1990 1995 2000 2010 
The exponential growth of data over the decades has fueled AI advancement.
Just imagine how much data is being created while you watch this video. Maybe you are sending a text message to a friend. At the same time, someone next to you might be on a call. Somebody else has just posted a photo on their social media page while another has started a new video series that piqued their interest on a streaming app.
The Data Explosion
Data is constantly being generated with each passing second. Every interaction with digital technology—from scrolling through social media to shopping online or even just having your phone in your pocket—creates new data points that can be analyzed by AI systems.
How We Produce Data
Correct... all these actions create new data. Let's explore some common ways we generate data in our daily lives:
People produce data through gaming, phone calls, watching TV, typing, and even at gas pumps.
A man plays a video game, a woman is on a cell phone, a TV displays a bird, hands type on a keyboard next to a gas pump. All of these everyday activities generate valuable data that AI systems can learn from.
Refining Raw Data
Yet this raw data requires careful refinement. Data needs to be refined because the quality of the dataset used to train algorithms have a direct influence on the accuracy of the AI model.
Raw data must be refined before it can be effectively used by AI models.
Quality Over Quantity
That means that diverse and representative high-quality data is essential to developing advanced AI models. The refinement process removes errors, inconsistencies, and biases that could affect the AI's performance.
Applications of Data in AI Systems
Consider a music streaming service. It uses the data from your listening habits, such as the songs you skip, the ones you play on repeat, and the playlists you create, to recommend new music that you might like.
Your Daily Mix Your Top Songs 2024 Your Time Capsule A New Song For You 
Music streaming services use your listening data to make personalized recommendations.
This is a practical example of how data is used to enhance our everyday experiences and how datasets train the AI models to recommend the next song for you. And that is what we use machine learning for, to analyse and learn from the data. But it does not stop there.
From Data to Value
Once we have this information, we can use it to train AI models, improve products and services, make predictions, and even uncover new insights that were previously hidden. It's about recognizing patterns and making connections that might not be immediately obvious.
So, the next time you use your mobile phone, remember that every action you take, every piece of data you generate, contributes to this vast, interconnected web of information. And it is through understanding this data that we can truly unlock the potential of AI.

Chapter 1.04: Finding Patterns in Data
How AI identifies and utilizes patterns in data
Introduction Pattern Recognition AI and Patterns Social Media Business Applications 
Introduction to Patterns in Data
Data is constantly being created and refined to train AI models. But what exactly are these models looking for in the data?
AI systems look for patterns within vast amounts of seemingly random data.
Patterns
Patterns are identifiable repetitive behaviors or structures that occur within data. AI models are particularly good at recognizing these patterns, mainly because they have access to a large volume of data.
Pattern Recognition in Action
Let's consider LinkedIn as an example. Have you ever noticed how LinkedIn suggests people you might know or jobs that you might be interested in?
in David Senior Art Director at Microsoft, Barcelona Susanne Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft, Paris 
LinkedIn uses pattern recognition to suggest connections based on your profile and behavior.
It is not just based on your connections or job search history, but also on the behaviors of people all around the world who have similar connections or job interests.
Time-Based Patterns
What is really interesting is platforms like LinkedIn may look for patterns not only within your professional network and job preferences, but also in relation to the specific times you are active on the platform. For example, many people tend to browse apps during their lunch breaks or after work hours, so apps may suggest new connections or posts at those times too.
How AI Models Identify Patterns
This pattern identification does not just occur on platforms like LinkedIn, but with many companies across many apps and platforms.
#  #  #  
AI systems identify patterns across user behaviors to predict preferences and interests.
Imagine the benefits of understanding what users really want or even creating new consumption trends based on the market. This understanding allows companies to customise their services for each user, thereby enhancing the user experience and boosting satisfaction.
Pattern Recognition in Social Media
It is about using data to meet the needs of the user in the most effective way possible. Every click, every like, every search - these are all pieces of data. AI models process this vast amount of data to notice patterns.
Every click on a website provides data that AI can use to identify patterns and preferences.
These patterns help the AI model tailor your experience, making it more relevant and engaging. It is like having a personal assistant who knows exactly what you need, even before you do!
Business Applications of Pattern Recognition
Think about the World Cup. What are potentially the best-selling products before the tournament?
10 
Recognizing trends like team shirt sales during the World Cup helps businesses make strategic decisions.
You might be thinking team shirts. Recognizing this trend of team shirt consumption can provide a unique competitive edge for companies. It could even help in the new development of products or features.
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
But how does an AI model learn to recognize these patterns? Well, it does so through machine learning. In the next chapter, we'll explore how machine learning enables AI systems to identify and utilize patterns to make predictions and decisions.

Understanding the differences between AI and machine learning, and how machines learn from data
Introduction AI vs ML Learning Types Mathematical Foundations Learning Analogy 
Understanding Machine Learning
You might have heard the terms 'machine learning' and 'AI' used interchangeably, and you may be wondering, 'What is the difference?' Well, there is a difference, and it is important to understand how they are different.
AI ML What's the difference? Artificial intelligence Deep learning Machine learning 
Machine Learning is a subset of AI, but the two terms are often used interchangeably.
AI vs Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by software and machines. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI. This means that while all machine learning is AI, not all AI involves machine learning.
Distinguishing Between AI and Machine Learning
Machine learning is a type of AI where a machine learns from the data it has been given and can identify patterns in that data. It is also the process by which machines learn from data and improve their performance over time.
Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning All machine learning is AI, but not all AI involves machine learning. ML 
The relationship between AI and Machine Learning: ML is a specific approach within the broader field of AI.
Machine learning uses different types of techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The term 'Machine Learning' was introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959, who created a program that played draughts against itself.
Historical Origin
Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in computer gaming and AI, created a program that played draughts. The machine analyzed the game through repetitive plays, identifying strategies to win and avoid losses. Through playing the game and learning what to do to win, it began to detect recurring patterns and would increasingly follow a pattern.
Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning can be divided into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each approach has distinct characteristics and applications.
Supervised learning X Label: Cat Y Label: Dog Unsupervised learning Reinforcement learning + - 
The three primary types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
•	Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where inputs are paired with correct outputs.
•	Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and must find structure without guidance.
•	Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
To achieve effective machine learning, Samuel had to use mathematics. Concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics play a crucial role in understanding how machine learning algorithms learn from data and make predictions.
Linear Algebra: A = [a₁₁ a₁₂] [a₂₁ a₂₂] Calculus: f'(x) = lim Δx→0 [f(x+Δx) - f(x)]/Δx Probability: P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B) Statistics: σ² = Σ(xᵢ - μ)²/n 
Mathematical concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics form the foundation of machine learning algorithms.
These mathematical concepts help in optimizing the performance of the model, understanding the relationships within the data, and making accurate predictions. They are the building blocks that enable machines to learn from experience and improve over time.
The Bicycle Analogy: Learning from Experience
Need further clarity? Let's consider the analogy of learning to ride a bicycle to understand how machine learning works.
Learning Phase Application Phase 
The process of learning to ride a bicycle mirrors how machine learning models progress from initial training to independent performance.
Learning Through Experience
When you first learn to ride a bicycle, you might start with training wheels. These training wheels are like the initial data set that we feed into the machine learning model. They provide basic guidance and stability. As you practice more, you learn to balance, pedal, and steer. This mirrors how a machine learning model begins to recognize patterns during training.
Eventually, the training wheels come off, and you adapt to different situations – riding on hills or through crowds. Similarly, a machine learning model applies what it has learned to new data and tasks, improving its performance based on experience.
This draughts game and bicycle learning analogy highlight the fundamental concepts of machine learning: learning from experience, replicating results, and improving performance. As we continue to explore AI and its capabilities, remember that all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.

Chapter 1.06: Types of Machine Learning
Exploring supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches
Introduction Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning Deep Learning 
Learning Methods in Machine Learning
Ever wondered how you learned to ride a bike or play an instrument? It's all about learning from experience, correct? Well, machines can do that, too! They can learn in three main ways: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
Supervised Unsupervised Reinforcement AI 
Learning from experience is fundamental to human learning and machine learning.
Three Main Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms can be classified into three main types:
•	Supervised Learning: Algorithm is trained on data that's labeled with the correct answers
•	Unsupervised Learning: Algorithm is trained on unlabeled or raw data
•	Reinforcement Learning: Algorithm is trained by interacting with its environment to achieve a goal
Let's break down each type with a simple analogy: learning to play football.
Supervised Learning: Learning with a Trainer
In the first scenario of our football analogy, you have a trainer who supervises you and teaches you all the rules.
Rules 0:0 
In supervised learning, like football training, the algorithm learns from labeled examples provided by a "trainer."
They carefully explain that when the ball enters the goal, you earn a point, and when the ball goes out of play over the sideline, it must be thrown in by hand. They explain all the rules, how many players there are, how long the game lasts, and so on. In this case, you have a person supervising you and teaching you all the rules of the game.
How Supervised Learning Works
In supervised learning, the algorithm is given a set of input data along with the correct output (labels). It learns by finding patterns that map the input to the output. This is similar to how a football coach might show a player exactly what to do, and the player learns by following these instructions.
Examples of supervised learning applications include:
•	Email spam detection (spam or not spam)
•	Image recognition (identifying what's in an image)
•	Weather forecasting (predicting future weather based on historical data)
Unsupervised Learning: Figuring It Out on Your Own
In the second scenario of our football analogy, you are on your own. You start attending games every Thursday and Sunday without prior instruction.
? Cheering Groaning 
In unsupervised learning, like watching football games without instruction, the algorithm identifies patterns without being told what to look for.
Initially, you are puzzled. Why are players using their hands from the sidelines in a game primarily played with feet? Why is the crowd cheering when the ball hits the net, and why do they groan when it does not? But as you keep watching, you start recognizing patterns and understanding the game's dynamics.
Clustering and Association
Unsupervised learning algorithms find structure in data without explicit guidance. There are two main types:
•	Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (like recognizing that certain players on a team work together in specific formations)
•	Association: Discovering rules that describe relationships in the data (like understanding that when the ball goes into the net, the crowd cheers)
Applications include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.
Reinforcement Learning: Learning from Rewards
Now, let's consider a third scenario, which is like reinforcement learning. Imagine you are practicing penalty kicks.
Positive Reward Negative Reward 
In reinforcement learning, like practicing penalty kicks, the algorithm learns from positive and negative feedback.
Each time you score a goal, you feel a sense of achievement, which is a positive reward. Each time you miss, you feel disappointment, which is a negative reward. Over time, by trying different ways of kicking the ball and learning from the rewards, you improve your ability to score penalty kicks.
Reward-Based Learning
Reinforcement learning is based on an agent (the learner) that interacts with its environment, taking actions to maximize cumulative rewards. The key components are:
•	Agent: The decision-maker (like the football player)
•	Environment: The world in which the agent operates (the football field)
•	Actions: What the agent can do (different kick techniques)
•	Rewards: Feedback from the environment (scoring or missing)
Applications include game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and resource management.
Deep Learning: Taking Machine Learning Further
Remember, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI involves machine learning. Machine learning can be broken down into these types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. But we can go even deeper.
Input Layer Hidden Layer Output Layer 
Deep learning uses advanced neural networks with multiple layers to process complex information.
There are advanced forms of machine learning that mimic the human brain's own method of learning. They take the concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning and apply them on a much larger scale. This is called deep learning.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Just as neurons in the brain are connected to form a vast network, deep learning uses artificial neural networks with several layers - hence the term 'deep'.
These networks can learn and make decisions on their own. They excel at tasks such as:
•	Image and speech recognition
•	Natural language processing
•	Recommendation systems
•	Medical diagnoses
In conclusion, machine learning approaches vary based on the task at hand and the available data. Understanding these different types helps us appreciate how AI systems learn and adapt to solve complex problems. As we move forward, we'll explore deep learning in more detail and see how these neural networks are revolutionizing artificial intelligence.

GENERATION, DISTRIBUTION, TRANSMISSION 
The electrical energy is today an essential factor for the industrial and social development of any country. It is commonly obtained from non-re-generative sources such as fossil fuels, and as consumption per capita and population grow, its limited production needs to be efficiently managed to satisfy the increasing world demand. Modern electric power systems have grown and expanded geographical…

POWER PLANTS 
The generation of electrical energy consists of transforming a type of energy (chemical, kinetic, thermal, light, nuclear, solar, among others), into electrical energy. For industrial generation, facilities called power plants are used, which carry out some of the aforementioned transformations. These constitute the first step of the power supply system. As energy consumption will continue to in…

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
In the didactic laboratory for the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions, the challenge-based learning (CBL) approach focuses on providing students with practical, real-world challenges that allow them to apply theoretical knowledge in specific situations. Rather than simply presenting information passively, this approach engages students in solving problems and creating innovative solutions. Students are faced with challenges that simulate real-life and industry problems, such as process optimization, anomaly detection or efficiency improvement. Using the hardware and software available in the lab, as well as artificial intelligence tools, students work in teams to develop practical solutions that address these challenges.
